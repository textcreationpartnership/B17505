            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>AS in the Apostles days, some were</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Zealous about the Law, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding neither what they said, nor whereof they Affirmed; <hi>There are some in our days, who have the</hi> Covenant of Grace <hi>and the</hi> New Covenant <hi>much in their mouths, while yet they understand little of it, yea, are under very</hi> great Mistakes <hi>about it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Perhaps (Reader) thou wilt wonder to see a</hi> New Treatise <hi>of this</hi> Subject, <hi>upon which there are so many Extant. Yet it were to be wished, that in some of them there were not</hi> Multa Corigenda, <hi>foul</hi> Errata<hi>'s. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, let who will Write of it, instead of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to it a</hi> Finis, <hi>he may conclude with a</hi> Nonnulla Desiderantur, <hi>there are some things yet behind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Indeed the Subject is exceeding Copious, and withal, a</hi> necessary Subject <hi>to be oft Incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated. Without some knowledge of Gods Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, Men can neither understand God,
<pb facs="tcp:34554:3"/>nor Jesus Christ, nor Themselves aright.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Touching the</hi> Occasion <hi>of this present Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course being in Company with a Worthy special Friend, I was Speaking my Thoughts,</hi>
               <q>That most of the Prevailing Errors of our Times, were from Ignorance of the Covenant of Grace, or not being right in the Doctrine of it:</q>
               <hi>Whereupon he willed me to apply my Thoughts to that Subject. When Considering further with my self the dangerous Tendency, and</hi> sad Consequences <hi>of some</hi> Mistakes <hi>about it, I was ready to say</hi> [I also will shew my Opinion.] <hi>Now to make way for my Intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Discourse on the</hi> Covenant of Grace. <hi>it was very Requisite to Premise something of Mans State under the</hi> Covenant of Works.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Many Points relating to these Two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, I wittingly pass by, to Insist more larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on what I conceive very Needful at this Day, that might be an</hi> Antidote <hi>against Prevailing Errors, and a means of Establishing Souls in the</hi> present Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I conclude before-hand, some will account this Discourse a</hi> Dry Piece, <hi>to wit, Such as look only at the</hi> stirring of Affections. <hi>But</hi> woful Experience <hi>may Teach us, that it is as well a Christians Duty to see to the right</hi> Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting of <hi>his</hi> Judgment; <hi>for want of which, we have seen many sadly Tossed to and fro.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:34554:3"/>
            <p>
               <hi>The Scripture is</hi> Profitable for Doctrine, 2 Tim. 3.16. <hi>This is one end and use it serves for. And if the Doctrine herein laid down be Sound, and according to the</hi> Scriptures of Truth, <hi>I shall hope, it will not be</hi> Unprofit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Further, I must expect, others will be Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced, and take Distaste, meeting with some things here Cross to the</hi> Opinions, <hi>which they have</hi> Espoused. <hi>Yet I can say, the</hi> Discovery of Truth <hi>is my Endeavour and Design, (and not to</hi> lay open the Nakedness <hi>of any of a different Perswasion, further than it might serve that Way.) And sure I am, Truth ought to be dearer to us all, than our Credit, or World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Concerns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ʋpon a Review of the whole, I especially commend to thy serious Perusal, the Twelfth, and Thirteenth Proposition of the Covenant of Grace, beginning at</hi> Pag. 225. <hi>and ending at</hi> 297. <hi>shewing the</hi> Terms <hi>and</hi> Benefits <hi>of the Covenant of Grace, wherein every mans</hi> Grand concern <hi>lieth. Reader, if thou hast a mind to see, there I have Indeavoured to shew thee the</hi> things that belong unto thy Peace.

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I am not without hope, but through the Blessing of God, it may be of Good use to some. And otherwise no Reasons should have moved, no Perswasions should have prevailed with me to yield to the Publishing of it. The Success (I know) depends wholly on His Blessing.</hi>

            <p>I Design (God assisting) to Discourse of the <hi>two Covenants</hi> betwixt God and Man.
<note place="margin">The Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.</note> The right opening and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof might help to set and keep our <hi>Judgments right</hi> in many points of Divinity, and prevent our falling into many dangerous and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:34554:6"/>errors. And as <hi>Luther</hi> said (as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) upon his understanding of the point of free Justification by <hi>Christ's righteousness,</hi> that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he thought himself <hi>apertis portis in ipsum paradisum intrâsse,</hi> to have strait way entered into Paradise: And <hi>ibi continuò alia mihi facies totius Scripturae apparuit,</hi> forthwith the whole Scripture appeared to him with a <hi>new face;</hi> so it would no doubt to many, could they attain to a right and true notion of the <hi>Covenants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I have made choice of this Text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whereupon to ground my Discourse of the <hi>Covenant of works:</hi> As this was part of it; part of that first Covenant, God was pleased to make with Man in innocency.</p>
            <p>I confess the <hi>Covenant of Works</hi> made with <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency, is more darkly spoken of than the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Reason is obvious, because the first Covenant was <hi>soon broken,</hi> on man's part, that he can claim no priviledge or benefit by it. In this respect it is, <hi>as if it had never been.</hi> All man's hope of happiness depends wholly on that which is called <hi>the Covenant of Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore the <hi>promissory</hi> part of that first Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is not mentioned here, not spoken of expresly: but only <hi>implyed,</hi> and included in the threatning. The Text indeed runneth in the Form of a <hi>Law</hi> with a <hi>threatning.</hi> As we have no more expressed here; but,</p>
            <p n="1">1. A <hi>Precept,</hi> not to eat.—</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Sanction</hi> or penalty threatned, death in case man did eat, contrary to the charge, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept God had given him.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:34554:6"/>
            <p>Yet there is more included and implyed here: As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Promise: A promise of the continuance of <hi>Adam</hi>'s life and happiness, <hi>upon Condition</hi> that he continued his Obedience.</p>
            <p>When it is said <hi>[If thou disobeyest thou shalt dye.]</hi> it fairly intimates thus much,
<note place="margin">Poena enim denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciata inobedientiae non expectatur, ubi est obedientia. <hi>Coccei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de foed.</hi> c. 2. Sect. 24. p. 29.</note>
               <hi>[If thou wilt be Obedient</hi> in this thing, and whatsoever else I command thee, thou shalt surely live still, and be happy, thou shalt <hi>not dye.</hi>]</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Tenor</hi> of the first Covenant is included here, that it was [<hi>Do this and live,</hi> disobey and dye.] That the <hi>Stipulation,</hi> or Condition required of man in the first Covenant, was his perfect obedience to the will of God in all things, not only to the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> implanted in him, but also to any further Command of God's giving Forth.</p>
            <p>As we see in this positive Law, where the thing forbidden was <hi>lawful in it self,</hi> and only sinful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause forbidden, and forbidden, to prove and try his obedience. As this was indeed <hi>a fit trial</hi> of it, by a Law to restrain him from that, whereunto he had a <hi>Natural inclination,</hi> as unto other fruits in Paradise (<hi>Gen.</hi> 3.6.) and which was indifferent, (within <hi>mans liberty</hi> to take and eat) before the giving of that Law.</p>
            <p>But I say the Condition of the first Covenant was obedience to the will of God <hi>in all things;</hi> therefore it is rightly called the <hi>Covenant of works.</hi> As <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. we read of a <hi>Law of works</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinguished and opposed to the <hi>Law of Faith.</hi> The Tenor of it being <hi>[do this and live]</hi> implyed here in the threatning, If thou disobeyest <hi>in any thing,</hi> be
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34554:7"/>it but so much as in tasting of this fruit, (which here <hi>to try thy Obedience,</hi> I forbid thee to eat of) Thou shalt dye. As <hi>Grotius</hi> (<hi>de Satis.</hi> c. 3.) <hi>per unam Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciem peccati omne peccati genus indicatur, ut ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primit Lex eadem clarius explicata, Maledictus qui non manserit in omnibus praeceptis Legis,</hi> Deut. 27.26. Gal. 3.10.</p>
            <p>This [<hi>In the day thou eatest thereof, dying thou shalt dye,</hi> meaneth as much as that [<hi>Cursed is he that continueth not obedient</hi> in all things.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Law of works, the Law given to <hi>Adam,</hi> was more than <hi>a penal, and praemiant Law,</hi> more than a Law with a promise,
<note place="margin">It is true Gods Law with its Sanction may be called his Covenant, before mans consent, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the matter of it; but it is most properly a Covenant when it is consented unto, having then also the form of a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> and threatning annexed, that it was also a Covenant. I have this to say further, <hi>viz.</hi> that we cannot but suppose, that innocent <hi>Adam</hi> did fully <hi>consent to,</hi> and readily and thankfully accept of Gods <hi>Terms</hi> and proposals here [Obey and live, Disobey and dye.] When God had done so much for man in his <hi>Creation,</hi> making him a <hi>reasonable Creature;</hi> in, or after his <hi>own Image,</hi> able to yield perfect obedience, and when the said obedience was indisputably, <hi>indispensably</hi> his duty, whether God promised such a reward or not, to suppose now that man was not fully consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Terms offered, (which were most just and reasonable) for the continuation of his happiness, were to suppose that man was not what he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, (i. e. <hi>reasonable, and innocent,</hi>) This were to suppose, that God did not make man upright or perfect, but rather perverse, and to suppose that man <hi>lay cross</hi> to his Maker, even before
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34554:7"/>he fell, which is (no doubt) prodigiously false.</p>
            <p n="4">4. One thing more included here, and to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, is, that this <hi>Covenant,</hi> and <hi>Compact,</hi> was not made with <hi>Adam</hi> alone, but with him, and his posterity together. Their want of perfect confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to Gods Will and Law, (the thing required, and insisted on in the Covenant of works) rendring his posterity guilty of death, even as if they had set their teeth in the forbidden fruit. The <hi>penalty</hi> threatned to <hi>Adam</hi>'s breach of Covenant, we see <hi>inflicted</hi> on his posterity, that certainly they were <hi>involved</hi> in the <hi>Covenant</hi> with him, to be dealt withall upon the same Terms. Even Infants, who have not sinned after <hi>the similitude of</hi> Adam<hi>'s Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,</hi> yet through his disobedience (<hi>mediante cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptione,</hi> their nature by that means being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted) are subjected to the same death, and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Though <hi>Corrinus</hi> takes it thus,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cens. Amat. Arm.</hi> c. 9. p. 138.</note> death being threatned unto <hi>Adam that very day</hi> he sinned, therefore his posterity could not but partake of his punishment. As they must all of necessity <hi>dye in him,</hi> who were <hi>in his loins.</hi> Yet by his leave, this account he gives of the matter is <hi>utterly short</hi> of that account the holy Scripture giveth of it. The Apostle concludeth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. That by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, all the world of mankind became <hi>subject unto death;</hi> so as they are subject to it, not only to <hi>dye vertually</hi> in him but formally to undergoe the Sentence of death in their own persons.</p>
            <p>Now hence I lay down this Doctrinal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:34554:8"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> That God was pleased to Covenant with man at first, when in the state of innocency, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising to give him eternal life, upon <hi>Condition</hi> of his obeying perfectly and constantly; withall threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning death, if in the least point he should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey.</p>
            <p>And to help your understandings, and to lead you on to a clearer conception, and apprehension of the Nature of this <hi>first Covenant,</hi> I shall proceed <hi>by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain steps,</hi> laying down several propositions about it: humbly begging the Spirit of truth so to <hi>guide</hi> me, that I may not mislead you here.</p>

               <p>COncerning the <hi>Image of God</hi> wherein man was created, it is, questioned,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Wherein it did consist?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Not in the form and fashion of his body. <hi>Homo non est imago Dei ea parte, quâ bestiis similis est.</hi> Coccei. For God is a Spirit, and hath not any <hi>bodily shape,</hi> as the <hi>Audians,</hi> or <hi>Anthropomorphites</hi> of old dreamed. Therefore his Image most properly or primarily consists in something spiritual. It was a fond conceit of <hi>Osiander,</hi> that man was said to be created after <hi>Gods Image,</hi> because the Son of God
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34554:8"/>was to assume Man's Nature. But Christ was not the express Image of God in this respect.</p>
               <p>That Text <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. where he is called the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press image</hi> of his Fathers person,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Christus quum factus est homo, dicitur fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus esse nobis similis per omnia, dempto peccato. Illius igitur corpus ad imaginem nostri factum forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumque potius fuit, quam nostrum ad il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> Zanch.</note> doth certainly respect his <hi>Deity,</hi> not his humanity. His being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate. Christ's taking man's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on him, was his being made <hi>like to us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, the Scripture affirmeth this of man <hi>before his fall,</hi> that he then had the <hi>Image of God,</hi> and had he continued in that first Estate of integrity, there had been no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for the Son of God to be incarnate, to take man's Nature on him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But the <hi>Image of God</hi> in man, consisted in those things, which advanced him above the Inferiour Creatures, representing some Divine perfection, which according to our way of conceiving of God is formally predicated of him, or properly attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him. Which is either, 1. <hi>Ratione substantiae hominis, &amp; imprimis animae.</hi> The <hi>Natural Image</hi> of God in man. As God is a Spirit, and so the Soul. God is immortal, and so the Soul is immortal. Or, 2. <hi>Ratione dignitatis, &amp;</hi>

                  </note> which a Learned man of our own calleth the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Image</hi> of God. So man in that dominion which God gave him over the inferiour Creatures, (that were made for him) represented God, the <hi>Lord of all,</hi> being as a little God upon Earth.

               <p>Now as the <hi>Moral Faculties</hi> (to wit) those which are the proper seat of moral Good or Evil) are the chief,
<note place="margin">

Thes. 1. p. 94.</note> And as Moral Good is more Excellent than Natural, and Moral evil worse than Natural (as Christ, was subject to a world of evil of this last sort, and yet retained the <hi>Image of God,</hi> most fair, and unspotted, being free from the least touch of <hi>Moral evil:</hi>) Thus the Moral perfection of the faculties of the Soul, is man's highest perfection. And herein <hi>chiefly</hi> and <hi>eminently</hi> did God's Image in man consist. And nothing more opposite to the Image of God, than <hi>Moral pravity.</hi> As God hath more to doe in Natural Evils, than in Moral. He freely owneth his being the <hi>Author</hi> of Natural Evil, <hi>(is there any evil in the City, and the Lord hath not done it?)</hi> but it were blasphemy to make him the <hi>Author of Moral Evil,</hi> or Sin.</p>
               <p>The Image of God consists not <hi>only</hi> or <hi>chiefly</hi> in the <hi>Essence</hi> of the soul: nor only or chiefly in the <hi>powers</hi> and <hi>faculties</hi> of the soul (supposing there were any real distinction of the faculties from the Essence) which some make to be <hi>Speculum Trinitatis,</hi> the Glass of the Trinity. The Essence and Natural powers of the soul remain, now that the Image of God is defaced. Nor <hi>only,</hi> or <hi>chiefly</hi> in <hi>dominion</hi> over other Creatures (as some would have it) This would rather seem to be an Adjunct. (or however a less principal part of it) <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. <hi>Let us make man in our Image—and let them have dominion.</hi> And that it is a thing <hi>distinct,</hi> and <hi>separable</hi> too, from the Image of God, from what is principally intended <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> it, seemeth to follow from hence: that both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <hi>Eve</hi> are said to have been created in the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34554:9"/>Image of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.27. They were created both alike in the Image of God: but they were not both <hi>alike in dominion,</hi> the Woman being made for the Man, is subject to him. Again, the Angels (surely) had the Image of God in as <hi>eminent,</hi> or an higher degree, than Man had; yet were not they made Lords over this lower world, (as man was, <hi>Psal.</hi> 8.6.) that we can any where find. The <hi>Angels</hi> were made after Gods Image, to whom the <hi>dominion</hi> over infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Creatures did not so properly belong, as unto men.</p>
               <p>Indeed the Image of God seemeth more properly to denote <hi>some inward frame</hi> and complexion of soul, rather than any such <hi>Eternal priviledge</hi> or prerogative, as Lordship over the Creatures.</p>
               <p>Therefore we take the <hi>Image of God,</hi> especially and <hi>eminently</hi> to consist in those spiritual Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Knowledge, Righteousness, and Holiness. That <hi>inward Rectitude</hi> of mans Soul, <hi>God made man upright,</hi> Eccl. 7.29. where (whatsoever <hi>Socinians</hi> say) we must understand, <hi>upright</hi> in respect of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rectitude;</hi> (as Moral pravity is opposed to it) [finding out many Inventions.] Now what is the Moral <hi>Rectitude</hi> of the <hi>Ʋnderstanding,</hi> but sound Knowledge, and Wisdome? what is the moral <hi>recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> of the <hi>will,</hi> but Righteousness, and Holiness?</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>upright</hi> was man, when he came first out of Gods hand, <hi>no errour</hi> in his understanding, no irregularity in his will, no <hi>disorder</hi> in his Affections. A sign of which we see, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.25. They were <hi>both naked,</hi> the Man and his Wife, and were <hi>not ashamed. No uncomely</hi> motions to cause shame, such as they were sensible of after their fall, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.10. Naked innocency was Glorious, but naked sin and turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude a thing most ignominious.</p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:34554:10"/>
               <p>See what is meant by the <hi>Image of God,</hi> Eph. 4.24. That ye put on the new man, which <hi>after God is created in Righteousness, and true Holiness:</hi> such as the Saints are by spiritual <hi>Renovation,</hi> such was man at first by <hi>Creation,</hi> viz. Righteous and Holy; so much also is hinted in the word [renewed] v. 23. And be <hi>renewed</hi> in the spirit of your mind: Imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that man had such a <hi>frame of Spirit</hi> once. He was created after God in Righteousness and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of truth, that Image of God which is in some measure, <hi>renewed</hi> or restored in the Saints; see also <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. Those spiritual endowments, wherein a man <hi>comes nearest</hi> to God, that it appears God is his <hi>pattern,</hi> (as to be Righteous, Holy. <hi>Be ye holy, for I am holy,</hi> saith the Lord) these must needs be most properly Gods Image, this is to be made <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> or of a God-like Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (though Gods Essence, and Attributes are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable) to have those qualifications, which are the <hi>fairest representation</hi> of Gods perfections, which can be seen and found in any Creature.</p>
               <p>By the way, what a lustre is here put upon Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to commend it to us? <hi>Gods Image</hi> principally consists in this; would you be like God? <hi>Be holy, as he is holy.</hi> Though you cannot be <hi>as holy</hi> as he is, with an [as] of equallity; you may, and ought to be <hi>holy</hi> as he is holy, <hi>with an</hi> [as] <hi>of Similitude,</hi> and the more holy, the more God-like. No wonder, that the <hi>Saints</hi> are called the <hi>excellent ones</hi> in the Earth, <hi>Psa.</hi> 16.3.</p>
               <p>But what prodigious wickedness is it for any to scoff at Holiness? He that mocketh the poor, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth his Maker: How much more he that scoffs at purity? What a Diabolical disposition is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34554:10"/>that, which cannot but express an Antipathy, and Indignation against Holiness? surely they are very ill affected towards their Prince, that cannot indure to see his Picture, but will disgrace and throw dirt upon it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another Question here is, whether the Image of God in <hi>Adam</hi> was <hi>natural,</hi> or <hi>supernatural?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Here the <hi>Sociniaus</hi> take away the subject of the Question, as we understand it; They under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand no more <hi>by the Image of God,</hi> than that <hi>domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> man had over the Inferiour Creatures; denying, that <hi>Adam</hi> had any such thing as <hi>Original Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> holding that he was created in a <hi>middle state</hi> without any moral rectitude, or righteousness, which should more encline him to good, than evil. So some of the <hi>Popish Schoolmen</hi> would have man created, <hi>in puris Naturalibus,</hi> meaning without Grace, Holiness, or Righteousness; but the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath determined otherwise, God made man <hi>upright.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that Righteousness or uprightness concreated with (him, though if we <hi>take an Estimate</hi> of it, from what man is now since his fall, it is to be called supernatural, as being quite above Man's Nature now corrupted, by Sin, and not to be attained to by the <hi>power of Nature,</hi>) Man is restored to it only by supernatural grace; yet considering man in his <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive state,</hi> as he came first out of Gods hand, it was Natural to him; Not as following from his very Nature, Essence, or Faculties, <hi>Physico modo,</hi> nor as an essential part or property of man, naturally considered; nor only as perfecting, or adorning Man's Nature, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> grants it may in this respect be termed Natural. But as not above the <hi>Condition</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:34554:11"/>of Man's Nature at first, though it be above corrupt Nature; yet it was not <hi>supra naturam integram,</hi> above Man's Nature as at first. Nay it was <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio Moralis Naturae illi debita.</hi> It was a moral en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment or perfection some way due to man, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the end for which he was made. Not due <hi>by way of Merit,</hi> but of <hi>condecency,</hi> or congruity to Gods wisdom and goodness (as some express it) As the Natural Faculties of understanding and will <hi>were due to him,</hi> if God would have any <hi>reasonable Service</hi> from him. And if God had not conferred on man at first this <hi>moral Rectitude</hi> of mind, and will, together with his being (without which man was not <hi>fitted</hi> to acknowledge, serve, obey, and honour his Creator) he must needs have <hi>missed of his End,</hi> for which he made man a <hi>reasonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and not a <hi>bruit;</hi> so this work of his had not been <hi>very good.</hi> The Creation of man little to his praise, if he was, made to serve God, and not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with sufficient abilities to serve him. Suppose man created at first without Original Righteousness, and do you not thereby <hi>impute folly to his Maker?</hi> Is not this to impeach the Wisdom and Holiness of God? Yea, how could the Psalmist so much <hi>admire</hi> what the Lord had done for man at first, making him <hi>a little lower than the Angels,</hi> Psal. 8.5. when if he was made without true wisdom and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, he was little <hi>better than the beasts that perish,</hi> Psal. 49.20. And let it be considered whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>want of holiness</hi> and righteousness in a Creature <hi>capable</hi> thereof, but not sinful; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently whether to suppose man created without the same, be not to make God the <hi>Author of Sin.

So let it be considered, whether to deny that man at first had <hi>Original righteousness,</hi> be not to suppose Natural concupiscence (which is now in every one contrary thereto) to be <hi>from God and Nature,</hi> understand pure Nature) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore good in it self, not sinful, carnal, inordinate, concupiscence, or that propension in men to things forbidden is <hi>natural</hi> indeed, speaking of Man's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as it is corrupted by the Fall; yet it was not natural speaking of Man's Nature, as it was at first before he fell. Though as he had a body, he was inclined <hi>to things of sense,</hi> yet the <hi>Sensitive appetite</hi> was in perfect subjection to the <hi>higher powers</hi> of his Soul had he attended to hold the same in subjection. It was his Sin to suffer the <hi>sensitive appetite</hi> to rebell and rule in him. But had there been any such thing as <hi>inordinate, concupiscence</hi> or Rebellion of the sensitive appetite against reason, in Man's <hi>pure Nature</hi> as it came from God, this sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, there would be a necessity of holding with the <hi>Papists,</hi> that the Motions of the same were not Sin, any more than hunger and thirst; otherwise we should make God the <hi>Author of Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, attend to this Argument, to prove that <hi>Adam</hi> was created with <hi>Original Righteousness.</hi> Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Adam</hi> was created righteous, or unrighteous, or in a midle state betwixt righteous &amp; unrighteous, one of these you must hold. But certainly he was not created unrighteous; for that were again to make God <hi>the Author of Sin.</hi> That would be to say, God made man unrighteous, contrary to plain Scripture,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34554:12"/>and to the <hi>common sentence</hi> of all that are right in their <hi>senses,</hi> neither could he be in a <hi>state of Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency</hi> betwixt righteous and unrighteous; because man a reasonable creature <hi>was bound</hi> to be righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as soon as ever he had a being. And the least <hi>deflection</hi> in this Nature from the Rule of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, would be unrighteousness in him. It is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to conceive that man should be <hi>in medio negatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> here, neither righteous, nor unrighteous. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if we suppose man set in such a state by God, still this foul and <hi>horrid consequence</hi> would follow, that God was no more the cause of Man's holiness and happiness had he stood, than of his sin and misery, when he fell: That he should no more have <hi>owned any praise</hi> and thanks to his Maker, had he chosen and persisted in the way of righteousness; than he can <hi>justly charge</hi> God with his sin and perdition.</p>
               <p>But thus I hope it sufficiently appears, that <hi>Adam</hi> had Original Righteousness <hi>concreated</hi> with him, and connatural to him. This Original Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness was then <hi>Natural,</hi> as opposed to <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural.</hi> It was not above the Condition of Man's Nature then, but <hi>requisite</hi> for the <hi>state,</hi> wherein he was, and <hi>the end</hi> for which he was made. Again, this Original righteousness in <hi>Adam</hi> was <hi>Natural</hi> in another respect, as opposed to what is <hi>meerly perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi> (as Original Corruption is Natural.) It should have ben <hi>derived</hi> and conveyed with his Nature to his Posterity; had he kept it. Holiness and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness is not Natural to the Saints, that have God's Image in some measure restored. It is <hi>supernatural</hi> to us now, that we cannot convey it to our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. But it was <hi>Natural</hi> to <hi>Adam,</hi> at first, and and so, that had he not lost it, it should have been <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:34554:12"/>to his posterity, as now the Corruption of his Nature is propagated.</p>
               <p>Ah! How is man <hi>changed</hi> from what he was at first? How are we <hi>sunk in our kind?</hi> Man was <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right</hi> at first, but now miserably depraved, he that was <hi>little lower than the Angels by</hi> Creation, by his own degeneration is become <hi>like the beasts that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.</hi> Of all our losses the loss of Gods Image; this, this is the greatest. A loss ever to be lamented. The <hi>Crown is fallen from our heads, woe unto us, that we have sinned.</hi>

               <p>AN Obligation to obey our Creator, is a <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral resultancy</hi> from our Condition, as we are Creatures.

               <p>Now what should we think of such <hi>Divinity</hi> as this?
<note place="margin">Mar. of Mod. Div. p. 154.</note> That Believers are not concerned with, nor obliged by the Law of God, as delivered by <hi>God Creator,</hi> but only as delivered and confirmed <hi>by Christ,</hi> or God in Christ, our Redeemer; That they are no more to look, at the <hi>Moral Law</hi> as in the hands of <hi>God-Creator,</hi> or as in the hands of <hi>Moses;</hi> but only as in the <hi>hands of Christ,</hi> to receive the ten Commandments <hi>only,</hi> as they are the <hi>Law of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot but look upon such Doctrine as very dangerous, tending to subvert the <hi>very foundation</hi> of true Piety and Religion. I take that to be very sound (<hi>Assemb. Confes. of Faith,</hi> c. 19. Sect. 5.) <q>The Moral Law doth for ever bind all, as well justified persons, as others, to the obedience thereof; and that not only in regard of the matter contained in it, but also of the Authority of God the Creator, who gave it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Yet I grant, we are to receive the Law not only as delivered by the Creator, or as delivered by him immediately without a Redeemer; neither are we to receive it from Christ, the Redeemer only, as excluding the Authority of the Creator.</p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:34554:14"/>
               <p>True it is, <q>We are under no Law here, but what is the Law of Christ, as being <hi>(jure Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis)</hi> the Universal King. (As Learned Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>) The Law of Christ is, First, The Law of Nature-redeemed in his hand. Secondly, His pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar super-added remedying Law. The former is now part of the precepts of Christ, and bindeth us to perfection, <hi>necessitate praecepti;</hi> though not <hi>medii,</hi> in regard of the pardoning promise.</q> Yet this does not take away all Authority from God, as if the Law was quite taken out of the Creator's hand, when it was put into the hand of Christ. We read <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.22. <hi>The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son.</hi> And yet in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. <hi>The Father judgeth without respect of persons, according to every mans work.</hi> Though he judgeth not <hi>executively,</hi> so as Christ does, who shall pronounce the Sentence in an audible manner; yet he judgeth <hi>Authoritatively,</hi> in, and with, and by Christ. The Father is not stripped of his right, and Authority of judging, by committing judgment to the Son. That is not the meaning of <hi>[The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther judgeth no man:]</hi> but that he judgeth not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self alone without the Son, but with, and by the Son; so though the Law be in the <hi>hand of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,</hi> yet it is not thereby quite taken out of the <hi>Creators hand;</hi> It is not the Son only, that rules and governs by his Love; but the Father in, and by him. And let it be considered, whether the damned are not so <hi>under the Law of God-Creator,</hi> that all their hatred of God, and blasphemy against him, is sin? And when Christ shall have delivered up the Kingdom to the Father, whether the Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven shall not be <hi>under the Law of God Creator?</hi> so
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:34554:14"/>that if they should not continue to obey perfectly, they should sin. And whether never till men come into the other world, they come under this Law of their Creator, or were they not under it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?</p>
               <p>That the Law of God as Creator should not oblige all men, as they are his Creatures, is a wonderful strange <hi>Paradox</hi> to me. If Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <hi>as they are his Commands,</hi> do not consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute and determine Man's duty, and lay a necessary tye upon man to Obedience, then God hath <hi>lost his Authority</hi> over man (this is plain) or man is advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced above the <hi>condition</hi> of a creature. But do not the holy Angels <hi>obey the Commands</hi> of God, as the Commands of their Creator (<hi>Psal.</hi> 103.20.) and shall we think man is <hi>exempted</hi> from Obedience in that respect? Has man a priviledge here above the Angels in Heaven? And what will be their duty to Eternity, to love, praise, serve, and worship God, and observe his pleasure, <hi>as being their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;</hi> can this be a sin, and weakness in believers; we read <hi>John</hi> 5.23. <hi>That all men should honour the Son even as they honour the Father:</hi> But they that hold the Law of God binded them, not as it is <hi>Gods Law,</hi> but only as it is the Law of Christ, would seem to honour him, <hi>not as the Father, but above</hi> the Father. And of whom doth the Apostle <hi>James</hi> speak, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.12. <hi>There is one Law-giver, who is able to save, and to destroy:</hi> Is it not the same <hi>with him, that said, Do not commit Adultery, that said, Do not kill,</hi> Jam. 2.11. The same with him that gave the Law in Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> where if you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand Christ, as God, you necessarily include the Father. If you understand <hi>Christ, as Mediator,</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:34554:15"/>then you suppose the Law given in Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> to be given from the hand of Christ, as Mediator.</p>
               <p>Now grant this, that the Laws and Commands of God are immediately constitutive of mans duty, or Obligatory, even <hi>because, or as they are</hi> the Laws and Commands of God, (and grant this you must, or you quite overthrow <hi>the course of Nature,</hi> utterly confound the <hi>order of beings,</hi> make the creature independant, and <hi>sui juris,</hi> Lord of it self, you deny Gods Dominion and <hi>Authority,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by race the foundation of all Religion, and cannot glorifie him, as God, but rather deny him to be God.) But, I say, granting the commands of God, his Laws certainly binding to his creatures, even <hi>because they are his,</hi> and then (methinks) the dispute [whether the Law of God oblige, as given by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>] may be waved, we should agree in this (sure) that the Law of God, howsoever, or by <hi>whomsoever,</hi> promulged, and declared, is binding to his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And therefore if the Decalogue, or ten Commandments given to <hi>Moses,</hi> and by him <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to the Jews, be declarative of the Commanding will of God,</hi> as a Copy and transcript of the Law of Nature, that standing Law of perpetual right, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the duty which God requireth of man, <hi>as man;</hi> it is for us, and all the men in the world, to look into it, to observe it, as well as it was for the <hi>Jews.</hi> It is the <hi>Duty of all men,</hi> who are Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and his subjects, to use all possible means of coming acquainted with the <hi>will of God</hi> their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Lord. And so far as the Writings of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, do <hi>reveal and declare</hi> the <hi>will of God</hi> concerning us, what he requires of us, and all men, as well as of the <hi>Iews;</hi> so far we
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:34554:15"/>are concerned with what they wrote, as well as the <hi>Iews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whatever the writer whom I have had here last to deal with, saith of the <hi>Law-binding</hi> belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, only <hi>in the hand of Christ;</hi> yet he clearly <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes</hi> and contradicts himself in several passages, cited with approbation out of many sound Divines.

                  <note place="margin">p. 153.</note> Again he citeth the same Author, together with Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> saying,

                  <q>The ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being <hi>the substance of the Law of Nature</hi> Engraven in the heart of man in innocency; and the express <hi>Idaea</hi> or representation of Gods own Image, even a beam of his own holiness, they were to have been a <hi>Rule of life (N.

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Now if by the <hi>Law of Creation</hi> man oweth all Obedience to God, and God hath given the Moral Law to be <hi>an Eternal rule of Righteousness,</hi> which should have been a rule to <hi>Adam</hi> and his posterity <hi>(as they were Gods Creatures)</hi> though there had never been a Covenant of works; what follows, but that the Moral Law is binding to believers, <hi>as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34554:16"/>they are Creatures,</hi> and this is the standing Law of their Creator, though it is also further binding to us, as confirmed by Christ, and in the hand of Christ.</p>
               <p>And thus that distinction of a Threefold Law, <hi>viz. [The Law of Works, the Law of Faith, and the Law of Christ,]</hi> as he explains, and applyes it, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be very <hi>weak</hi> and unprofitable; yea, unsafe; though he layes so great stress upon it, as to tell us, <q>That so far forth as any man <hi>comes short</hi> of the true knowledge of this threefold Law, so far he comes short both of the <hi>true knowledge</hi> of God, and of himself.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But, 1. One would think, that the <hi>Law of Faith</hi> (to speak properly) should be the <hi>Law of Christ;</hi> yet he distinguishes between the Law of Faith, and the Law of Christ.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Apostle distinguisheth betwixt the <hi>Law of Works</hi> and of <hi>Faith,</hi> Rom. 3.27. but never betwixt the Law <hi>of Faith,</hi> and the Law <hi>of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. I think the common distinction <hi>of a Covenant of works,</hi> and <hi>of Grace;</hi> or as others express it, The old <hi>Original Law,</hi> and the new <hi>Remedying Law,</hi> much clearer, and to better purpose.</p>
               <p n="4">4. His opposing the <hi>Moral Law, as in the hand of God-Creator</hi> to the same Law as in <hi>the hand of Christ,</hi> and holding that believers are only bound by the Law, <hi>as delivered by Christ,</hi> is intollerable. It is granted, that we are not under the Law, only as delivered by the Creator, not under the Law of Nature, as meerly created, or as given at first to man in innocency, but he opposeth those as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which ought to be conjoyned. As if we could not be bound by the Law, both as it is the Law of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:34554:16"/>our Creator, and as it is the Law of our Redeemer; but are free from it in the former respect, if bound in the latter: This seems intollerable. For so it follows,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Believers are not <hi>redeemed unto God</hi> by his blood (as <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9.) but rather <hi>redeemed from him,</hi> not to owe that subjection to him, which they did before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That through the redemption of Christ, they are advanced <hi>above the Condition</hi> of Creatures. For by the Law of Creation, as <hi>Creatures,</hi> they are bound to obey the Law of their Creator. But certainly Christians in being redeemed by Christ, do not <hi>cease to be creatures.</hi> I say you do not cease to be creatures, when you become Christians, nor does God <hi>lose the Right</hi> he had in you before, to require Obedience from you; but he hath now a further right in you. The old Obligation by your creation is not taken off, but still in force, when this new Obligation, by your Redemption is further added, and lay'd on you.</p>
               <p n="3">3. According to what this writer layes down, it is the priviledge of believers, not to have any after Sins pardoned, and remitted as <hi>to the guilt of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting punishment;</hi> but only as to the prevention, or removal of some temporal chastisements. They are under no Law, but the Law of Christ; and Christ's Law threatens no other penalty than Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly chastisement.
<note place="margin">Pag. 154. 199, 200.</note>
                  <q>That [if need be] you shall be as sure of Temporal corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as an Unbeliever of Eternal dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</q> And to be corrected <hi>if need be,</hi> is not so much a penalty, <hi>as a mercy.</hi> I am sure, the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is sometimes threatned, as a <hi>sore Judgment. [Why should ye be smitten any more? I will not
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:34554:17"/>punish your daughters when they commit Whoredome.</hi> Ephraim <hi>is joyned to Idols, let him alone.</hi>] But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a believer must not <hi>conceit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 202.</note>
                  <hi>that till his Sin be pardoned, he is liable to be condemned for it.</hi> So the matter is brought to this Issue, that for the Sins which a man commits after he believes, he hath no need of pardon, nor can be (with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing) pray for the pardon of his sins, not only in that <hi>more famous</hi> sence, that we use the word [pardon] in: But even in the <hi>lowest</hi> sence, wherein the word is ever used. He hath no need of pardon <hi>to free him from Condemnation,</hi> because no sin can make him <hi>liable to Condemnation.</hi> Again, he hath no need of pardon, to <hi>free</hi> him from <hi>Temporal chastisements;</hi> because it is not threatned, but <hi>when there is need</hi> for it; and when there is need for it, a <hi>sanctified cross</hi> hath more of mercy in it, than an <hi>unsanctified Comfort,</hi> where a person is not by any Law liable to any punishment, such a person (sure) has no need of pardon.</p>
               <p>But I should think that believers as they are crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, are bound to obey God in all things, and that Christ came not to take off the obligation to duty and obedience, but to take off the obligation to wrath and punishment. That their sins are properly sins, as against Gods Law, and deserve punishment, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve hell in their own Nature, as well as the Sins of others. Only they have this relief by the new Covenaant, they shall not be condemned for them.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the third Propoposition, <hi>viz.</hi> Man being a reasonable Creature, he oweth Moral Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Maker. Now it follows.</p>

                  <hi>PROP. IV.</hi> Therefore God rules and governs man <hi>after another manner,</hi> than inanimate things, and brutes, are governed. His Kingdom <hi>ruleth over all. Natural Agents</hi> are ruled by his <hi>power and providence.</hi> But man he ruleth also a moral Agent, <hi>by Precepts, Promises and Threatnings.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>ANd if the Lord had not designed in the <hi>Making</hi> of Man, thus to govern him, then might not one use the Psalmist <hi>expostulation</hi> (though in another sence) <hi>wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?</hi> wherefore hath he endowed us with a Faculty of <hi>discerning</hi> right and wrong, good and evil? And why hath he given us a capacity to <hi>look backwards</hi> to reflect on our wayes and actions, a power of setting up a <hi>Iudgment-seat,</hi> within our selves, to call our selves to account? And why hath he given us a capacity of <hi>looking forwards,</hi> to consider with our selves whether our present course tends, why hath God placed such a <hi>power</hi> as <hi>Conscience</hi> in men, Conscience, I say to <hi>check, curb,</hi> and <hi>restrain</hi> us from Sin, to <hi>spur</hi> on and quicken us to duty, to accuse, or excuse, to Prophesie good or evil, to give <hi>Sentence</hi> for us or against us; and why hath God planted such <hi>affections</hi> in men, as <hi>Desire, Hope, Fear,</hi> all respecting some absent, remote, future good or evil! How is it, we can dread <hi>evil threatned,</hi> or have any hope of <hi>good promised,</hi> if it were not
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34554:18"/>the will of God, that we should be governed, not as Bruets, that are led on to things by a meer <hi>Natural instinct,</hi> without reason; but as rational Moral Agents, by such Moral means, as Laws, Promises, Threatnings.</p>
               <p>And here again I cannot but enter my dissent, and declare my dislike of what that writer, with whom I had to do before, layes down so confidently, that a true believer is to obey;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Marrow</hi> p. 209.</note> yea, does obey, <hi>without fear of Hell, or hope of Heaven.</hi> And so far forth as they eschew evil,
<note place="margin">p. 172. 176, 177, 178.</note> or do good, for fear of Hell, or hope of Heaven, their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is but <hi>slavish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I shall not say much here concerning the fear of punishment, because I shall have occasion to speak of that afterwards.</p>
               <p>And to prevent misunderstanding, I shall lay this down, That a true believer does not obey God <hi>meerly</hi> out of such self-respect, as for fear of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or hope of reward. No, he hath a true <hi>love to God,</hi> and a love to the <hi>Law of God.</hi> As the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.22. <hi>I delight in the Law of God after the inward man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as he hath a love to God, and obeyeth in love, so he hath, and ought to have a love to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self too. And although gracious Souls in some holy raptures, have the Love of God so far prevailing in them sometimes, that for the present they would seem quite to forget themselves, and to <hi>set aside all respect</hi> to their own Souls, as it was with holy <hi>Paul</hi> there, where (had it been possible) he could have wished himself <hi>accursed from Christ</hi>— Rom. 9. Yet it is not thus with them ordinarily, neither yet
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:34554:18"/>may we say, that so far as Christians look, and aim at their own happiness, so far they <hi>degenerate</hi> and act like <hi>Slaves,</hi> not like themselves. <hi>All love</hi> of the reward is not a <hi>mercenary love:</hi> but when men only respect the reward. Now a Child of God hath <hi>a love to his work,</hi> as well as to his <hi>reward,</hi> Gods commands are not grievous to him; but indeed this is grievous to him, that he is no more conformed to Gods commands. And were it put to such an ones choice, he would not desire any liberty to transgress them, but would have more power to keep them. But what a gross mistake is this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause men are not <hi>only</hi> to obey for fear of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or <hi>only</hi> in hope of reward, to conclude thus, therefore they are not at all to regard either what God hath threatned, or promised.</p>
               <p>And if it were so, that men were not to obey with any respect to what God hath promised them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. How great a part of Scripture is given to us in vain, but all Scripture is profitable—to make the Man of God <hi>perfect,</hi> and to perfect the Godly man, that he may be <hi>thorowly furnished</hi> to every good work. Shall we think that God hath made so many <hi>promises in vain.</hi> That those great and <hi>precious</hi> promises in Scripture are but <hi>Cyphers,</hi> and stand for nothing?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Is it not <hi>horrible pride</hi> for men to think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves more perfect than innocent <hi>Adam</hi> was, to conceit that they yield obedience unto God upon more <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>spiritual</hi> grounds and <hi>motives?</hi> This is evident, that the Law given to innocent <hi>Adam,</hi> was backed with a threatning, and a promise. And so it was his duty both to dread the threatning, and to have regard unto Gods promise.</p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:34554:19"/>
               <p n="3">3. I can boldly say, that to have no thoughts of our own everlasting happiness, not to look at that, is such a <hi>strange piece of self denial</hi> as the Lord no where allows; much less does he command, or commend. Is it not contrary to such Scriptures as these, <hi>Seek first the Kingdom of God, work out your own Salvation—Lay hold on eternal life?</hi> It is a carnal Self-love, and self-seeking, which is mens sin and shame too. As what can be <hi>more absurd,</hi> and irrational, than for men to care for the body, but neglect their precious immortal Souls, to labour for <hi>the meat that perisheth,</hi> and not to be at any pains for <hi>that meat which indureth to everlasting life?</hi> To be wholly taken up with things present, things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that are but <hi>temporal,</hi> not regarding the things above, which are <hi>eternal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. And if true Believers are supposed to be of <hi>such a strain,</hi> as to obey without eying the promised reward at all; then it follows they are <hi>better than Moses,</hi> the man of God. <hi>For he had respect unto Recompence of the reward.</hi> Heb. 11.26. And yet you are to observe, he is their <hi>commended</hi> for so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And this is made an expression, and effect of his Faith, <hi>v.</hi> 24, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea, this would seem to be an <hi>out-doing</hi> of the blessed <hi>Apostles.</hi> We <hi>run</hi> and <hi>strive</hi> to obtain a Crown incorruptible, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.25. we look at the things which are not seen, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.14. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. These are the <hi>marks</hi> we aim at. Yea, which I even tremble to mention, this would make Christians <hi>better than their Masters,</hi> would set the Servant above their Lord. Do we not read of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> that <hi>for the joy that was set before him, he endured the Cross,</hi> Heb. 12.2.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:34554:19"/>
               <p n="5">5. How glorious a pretence soever men may have for their <hi>setting aside all respect</hi> to the promised re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; yet it is really and indeed a sinful sleighting, and <hi>contempt of Gods Grace, Bounty, Goodness;</hi> so the Sadduces had their <hi>fair pretence,</hi> that God was to be loved for himself, which is a certain truth: but (mark it) this is <hi>not the whole truth.</hi> For God is also to be loved, served, for what he is, and would be to those that love him. We ought to love God, not only because he is infinitely worthy of love in himself (in regard of his own <hi>infinite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies,</hi> and perfections) but also because he is so loving, and gracious to, and such a bountiful <hi>rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> of them that seek him, and love him. Where is the Mouth that dare deny, that God is even in this respect also to be loved, served, honoured of his creatures?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Though men will sometimes <hi>talk at randome,</hi> without weighing or considering what they say; yet the truth is, it is impossible that one <hi>right in his wits</hi> should not have a desire of his own everlasting happiness. And certainly it is very great rashness for any to make that a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a distinguishing sign of a true believer, which would rather prove one not a man, or <hi>reasonable.</hi> The Service which God requireth of us, is reasonable Service; but it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, when God hath revealed and propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to us inconceiveable, everlasting happiness, that we should not believe it; or that believing there is such happiness to be had, and obtained, we should not most earnest desire, and indefatigably pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue and press after the attainment of it. And what can <hi>sound</hi> more <hi>strangely</hi> than this, that it is not a Christians <hi>duty,</hi> but rather his Infirmity by patient
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:34554:20"/>continuance in well-doing <hi>to seek for Glory, Honour, Immortality, Eternal life?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. What is the happiness of Heaven, but the most full and glorious <hi>enjoyment of God?</hi> That to obey in hopes of Heaven, is indeed to obey and serve God <hi>for himself.</hi> Are we to seek after the enjoyment of God in every Duty and Ordinance, as when we pray, hear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is his presence to be <hi>sought on earth,</hi> and not much more to be <hi>desired in Heaven?</hi> Much more I could say here, but I hope this may satisfie: All is not Gold (Sirs) that gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters; nor all those Notions Gospel Doctrines, which many pretend to be so.</p>
               <p>What is here said, I hope may help (through Gods blessing) to deliver some poor doubting trembling Soul out of one <hi>great snare,</hi> that some, who mean well, yet being unwary lay before them.</p>
               <p>Certainly, I should tremble to think of making this the <hi>Touchstone</hi> to try my own, or your Faith, by, <hi>scil. [Doing what the Lord requires, without any hope of Heaven, or eying of the promised reward.]</hi> You may follow vertue (holiness) <hi>&amp; virtutis amore, &amp; mercedis amore,</hi> both from a love to vertue it self, and to the reward of vertue, so much I think is implyed in <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.22. <hi>Ye have your fruit unto holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and the end everlasting life.</hi> And to follow after holiness, as that without which we cannot come to the enjoyment of God, and happiness, is to attend to the <hi>Scripture direction,</hi> Heb. 12.14. and therefore cannot but be safe. If holiness be the way to happiness, by Gods <hi>appointment,</hi> and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness <hi>the end</hi> of holiness; then certainly we ought to follow after holiness, not only for its <hi>own sake;</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:34554:20"/>but also for the tendency it hath to true and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting happiness. And though there be <hi>a truth</hi> in it, that vertue and goodness is a reward of it self, and to be loved for it self; yet it is not <hi>true,</hi> that where this is, a man desires no other reward, looks no further, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.35. <hi>Cast not away your confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which hath great recompence of reward.</hi> This Consideration should move us to continue in faith and holiness, that there <hi>is great recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;</hi> That to quicken and encourage our selves, on in a <hi>way of holiness</hi> and obedience, by the thoughts of what the Lord hath graciously promised there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, this is (you may clearly see) <hi>according to the Scripture;</hi> and the other way, wherein men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to do all out of <hi>pure love</hi> to God, without any regard to their own happiness, is a being religious and <hi>holy above the Scriptures.</hi> But certainly they overshoot themselves, that pretend to an higher way, a more spiritual and <hi>excellent way,</hi> than that which is shown us in the Scriptures.</p>

                  <hi>PROP. V.</hi> It is evident and undeniable, that sundry of Gods Laws (comprised in that which is called <hi>the Law of Nature)</hi> are of Moral, perpetual right, and equity, commanding what cannot but be mans duty, requiring such things, as have an <hi>unchangeable good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>comliness</hi> in them. Forbidding such things as have an unchangeable horrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and odiousness in them. Some things are good, and some things are evil <hi>in their own Nature,</hi> and therefore are so perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, invariably, necessarily; that it is <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible</hi> that a righteous and holy God should not command the one, and prohibit, and condemn the other: Such precepts (as some well observe) depend on Gods <hi>righteous Nature,</hi> rather than on his <hi>Soveraign Will.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THerefore upon the Question, whether God at any time hath dispensed with the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> or with any purely Moral precept, I should incline to those that say (notwithstanding those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances that are brought seemingly contrary) The Law of Nature was not dispensed with, no change <hi>in the Law;</hi> only their was a change in the <hi>matter</hi> or Object, and that <hi>immutatio materiae</hi> made by
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:34554:21"/>God not as <hi>legislator,</hi> but as <hi>Dominus,</hi> as <hi>Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> or Owner. That when God commanded <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> to Sacrifice his Son, he might do it from the <hi>absolute Dominion</hi> he hath over all mens lives; and if <hi>Abraham</hi> had Sacrificed him upon God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, it had not been <hi>Murder.</hi> but the highest Act of Obedience. The <hi>Israelites</hi> taking away the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> Gods; when God had <hi>altered the property</hi> of them, (as Lord and Judge proceeding against the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> in justice, as against <hi>Delinquents</hi> that had forfeited the same, and making over (by his <hi>free donation</hi>) the right and title to them to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; I say the <hi>Israelites</hi> possessing themselves of what was no longer the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> but indeed their own, by <hi>Gods disposition and free gift</hi>) this cannot be accounted <hi>Theft.</hi> And may it not be thought, that according to an <hi>Equitable construction of the Law:</hi> Such Instances, or Cases as these, were no more prohibited, than works of Piety, Mercy, and Necessity are forbidden (in the Law) on the Sabbath day (compare <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.10. with <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.5.7.)</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Matter,</hi> or <hi>Object,</hi> about which the Law was conversant, may be changed, when yet the Law it self, is not changed, but as obliging as ever.</p>
               <p>Again, some commands there are in the <hi>Morall Law,</hi> the very matter whereof is unalterable (the <hi>foundation</hi> never ceasing or changing) as some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in the Three first Commandments of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue.</hi> Thus it is Man's <hi>duty for ever</hi> to fear, love, believe, serve, honour God. Thus it cannot but be <hi>horrid wickedness,</hi> for any one to blaspheme, or contemn God; to doubt of his truth, power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now this is of <hi>Immutable Equity,</hi> that what is <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:34554:22"/>good,</hi> and cannot be otherwise, should be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and the reasonable creature bound to it; that what is <hi>morally evil,</hi> and cannot but be evil, should be forbidden. And to affirm that God may <hi>cease to command,</hi> or approve of what is so <hi>intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secally, necessarily, everlastingly</hi> evil, is to set up his absolute Soveraignty in such wise, as to <hi>justle</hi> out his infinite goodness, purity, and holiness; that is, to set his glorious <hi>Attributes at variance</hi> one with another. But certainly the Judges, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of all the world can <hi>do, and command nothing,</hi> but that which is right. <hi>Plutarch</hi> had rather men should have said, <hi>Nullum esse</hi> Plutarchum, <hi>quam malum esse</hi> Plutarchum; That there was no such man as <hi>Plutarch,</hi> than that <hi>Plutarch</hi> was a wicked man; and so he held it worse, <hi>De Deo male sentire, quam Deum esse negare,</hi> to entertain any wicked opinion of God, than to deny God. This is (no doubt) a very <hi>monstrous conception</hi> of him, to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that he should not will, and command vertue and holiness; or that he should not utterly disallow of vice and wickedness. 'Tis part of the <hi>Charge</hi> brought in against the wicked, <hi>Psal.</hi> 20.21. Thou thoughtest that I was altogether <hi>such a one as thy self:</hi> But (sayes the holy one) I will reprove rhee for it, Well therefore let this be laid down, as an <hi>everlasting truth,</hi> that there are some things which God can no <hi>more deny</hi> to be Man's duty, than he can <hi>deny himself.</hi> There are some precepts of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable force, and obligation, never to be repealed, abrogated, or dispensed with. The Lord can no more <hi>dispense</hi> with mens acknowledging, loving, reverenceing Him, that these should not be their duty, and the contrary sinful and damnable in their
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:34554:22"/>own Nature, than he can deny his own Divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and <hi>infinite perfection;</hi> so he can no more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of what is <hi>evil in it self,</hi> than he can do evil, or be evil; he can no more approve of <hi>mens lying</hi> and deceit, than he <hi>can lye,</hi> or deceive men Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. He can no more approve of Atheism, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneness, Hypocrisie, Pride, Envy, Malice, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness, and the like; than he can <hi>change,</hi> or cease to be <hi>what he is,</hi> an holy God of purer eyes than to behold iniquity.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe <hi>Law of Nature</hi> (as we have heard) in spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial enjoyns what is good, or forbids what is evil <hi>in their own Natures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Positive Laws</hi> are conversant about things neither good, nor evil in themselves, things of a <hi>middle Nature;</hi> which yet become Good when commanded of God, and evil when forbidden. Because it is <hi>good</hi> to obey God in all things; but very evil and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:34554:23"/>sinful to disobey God in any thing. The <hi>goodness</hi> of God would never command any thing evil <hi>in it self.</hi> And what the Lord commandeth though <hi>indifferent</hi> before, yet being commanded (in regard of his <hi>Soveraign Authority</hi> and Dominion) it becomes a <hi>necessary</hi> duty. As what he forbiddeth, though lawful enough before; yet being under a <hi>Divine prohibition,</hi> it becomes <hi>sinful.</hi> Of such <hi>purely posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> precepts we <hi>find this one</hi> given to Man in the state of Innocency for the tryal of his Obedience, <hi>Scil.</hi> this <hi>[of not eating of the tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil,]</hi> whether any more are to be found, that were purely positive, and given to Man in that state, I know not.</p>
               <p>And amongst all those Commands which our Lord Jesus Christ hath laid on his followers in the Gospel; some <hi>Inquisitive</hi> men have been able to discover no more than two (to wit, concerning <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper</hi>) that are meerly positive institutions. And these two appointed not <hi>only</hi> to try our Obedience; but for other <hi>high ends,</hi> and gracious purposes, to be Seals of the new and better Covenant, and special <hi>helps</hi> and furtherances unto Christians (through Gods blessing upon the due use of them) as means of promoting both their Grace and Comfort, and a <hi>strong engagement</hi> on them to Duty and Obedience. So that they are not meer Arbitrary <hi>impositions,</hi> shewing only the will and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of him that appointed them, but also <hi>pledges</hi> of his Grace and favour towards us; and are our great priviledges: As the promise in the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant speaks forth the wonderful Grace of God, so doth his <hi>instituting</hi> and annexing these Seals, to strengthen our faith in what he hath there promised.</p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:34554:23"/>
               <p>As for the Law of the Sabbath, there hath been enough written, to prove, that it is not <hi>a purely positive</hi> precept. When God hath given us all our time, to Question, whether a <hi>considerable part</hi> of it be not due to his special solemn Worship, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, seems very unreasonable. Nay, it would seem to be but <hi>Occasional, viz.</hi> in regard of man's present state in this world, the necessities of the outward man, that call him to earthly employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that he hath an allowance to follow these secular employments, when if it were not for this, his whole time would be due to God's more <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Service;</hi> as the Saints in Heaven keep a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, everlasting Sabbath.</p>
               <p>Now what is noted here, may shew us the <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful goodness</hi> of God towards us in Gospel times, in freeing us from the <hi>Law of Ceremonies,</hi> from such a multitude of <hi>burdensome impositions</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> were under. How easie is the <hi>yoke of Christ,</hi> compared with the yoke which was upon the necks of the <hi>Jews?</hi> So we may see here the <hi>reasonableness</hi> of the Christian-Religion. The Lord requires no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of us in the Gospel, but what is indeed <hi>good in it self,</hi> or at least good for us; imposeth nothing on us in the Gospel, meerly to shew his <hi>absolute Authority</hi> over us: Even the Positive Institutions of the Gospel are such as speak his gracious conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension towards us.</p>
               <p>Again by the way, we may here reflect upon the <hi>Tyranicalness</hi> of the <hi>man of Sin.</hi> What a multitude of <hi>strange impositions</hi> hath he brought into the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church, as envying Souls that liberty we have under the Gospel.</p>

               <p>
                  <q>HEre (<hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17.) is implyed upon condition of his obedience, the promise of eternal life, whereof the Tree of life was a sign, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.22. Ainsworth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To encourage men to yield free Obedience, God bound himself by his free promise to reward it.</p>
               <p>Here take notice of Gods gracious Nature. He would not rule man <hi>with rigour,</hi> but made the <hi>yoke of his Subjection</hi> as easie as man could possibly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, or reasonably desire. Besides the strong En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements that lye on the Creature to obey God, the Lord was pleased to give man all encouragement that might be.</p>
               <p>There is a Question, what life was promised unto <hi>Adam?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whether to live still <hi>in statu quo,</hi> to be continued upon earth in that happy state, wherein he was created, or whether after some time he should not have been advanced, and <hi>translated</hi> to a more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious estate in Heaven?</p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:34554:24"/>
               <p>Now some very worthy and Judicious Divines (I confess) are for the former, denying the latter. And others I know look upon the Decision of the Question (which way soever it be decided) as an <hi>unprofitable speculation;</hi> but I cannot so slight it, because if it appears to be an <hi>Heavenly happiness,</hi> that was promised, it further sets off the Grace of God towards man, which must needs have laid him under a greater obligation to obedience, and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness; so it doth the more set forth and aggravate man's sin and <hi>ingratitude,</hi> whom such <hi>cords</hi> did not, could not <hi>bind.</hi> Besides that it may be of some ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice against <hi>Socinians,</hi> who would have <hi>Adam</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to death by <hi>Creation,</hi> not by <hi>Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to the Question.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Those Divines that hold a life of happiness up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, only promised unto <hi>Adam,</hi> do grant the promise of life to be <hi>implyed in the threatning of death:</hi> Now if the threatning <hi>[dying thou shalt dye]</hi> did not only intend a privation of the life which <hi>Adam</hi> then enjoyed, but everlasting <hi>punishment in hell;</hi> Then it seems to follow, that the life here im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely promised is not to be understood only of the <hi>continuation</hi> of that life, which <hi>Adam</hi> lived in Paradice, but of everlasting life in Heaven.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That eternal life which the Scripture opposeth unto death <hi>(the wages of sin)</hi> Rom. 6.23. there is none that questioneth, but it is a life of happiness in Heaven.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Was not the Earthly Paradice a type of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the tree of life there, a type of Eternal life in Heaven (<hi>Rev.</hi> 2.7.) Had <hi>Adam</hi> the <hi>type of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and was it not to teach him what to expect, to look after a life of happiness in Heaven? unless you
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:34554:25"/>will say, Those were <hi>Types</hi> only since they were lost, not while they were, and might have been enjoyed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Was not innocent <hi>Adam</hi> as <hi>capable</hi> of Heavens happiness, as believers are now? And would it not be strange, that though he had <hi>kept his Integrity</hi> and innocency, yet he should never have enjoyed the chiefest Happiness and <hi>perfection,</hi> he was made for, was created capable of.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If <hi>Adam</hi> had continued innocent and obedient, may we not suppose, he should have had <hi>as many Children</hi> descending from him, as have sprung from him since the fall, who might have stood and been happy with him: Now whether seemeth more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, to suppose a <hi>translation</hi> of men up to Heaven <hi>(Successivè, &amp; suo ordine)</hi> by degrees and in their order, as it should please God to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state them; or to suppose their <hi>continuance all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> upon earth, where if we should suppose all the Generations of men that have been since <hi>Adam</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready <hi>existent</hi> here together;

                     <hi>Dissolution of Soul and Body</hi> should have been, if <hi>Adam</hi> had not sinned, which I can see no Reason to admit. Yet (as he says) the world would have been <hi>too litle</hi> to have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained those myriads of men, which must <hi>in all reason</hi> have been born from that blessing of <hi>[In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease and Multiply]</hi> which was given at the first Creation, and to have <hi>confined</hi> Mankind to the pleasures of this world in case he had not fallen, would have been a <hi>punishment</hi> of his innocency.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:34554:25"/>
               <p>Another Question here, whether it was of <hi>Grace,</hi> or of <hi>Justice,</hi> for God to promise <hi>Adam</hi> life, and happiness (as he did) upon his continued Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Of <hi>strict Justice</hi> it could not be; because he might have promised less, yea, might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised nothing at all <hi>de futuro,</hi> without any Injustice. I readily grant it inconsistent with Justice to punish, or afflict an innocent Creature eternally. Yet Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice does not require that the service, or obedience of a Creature be rewarded with everlasting, that is, <hi>infinite</hi> happiness. True it is, if <hi>Adam</hi> had tarried as he ought, <hi>doing well,</hi> he should have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, continuing his Obedience, he might have expected the <hi>complacential Love</hi> of God his Creator towards him, so long as the Lord was pleased to continue him in being; that while he was <hi>innocent,</hi> God would look on him as such, not <hi>hold him guilty.</hi> but it sounds strangely to say, God cannot make a rational innocent Creature, and annihilate, or <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make</hi> it again, if he pleaseth. To hold that he is <hi>bound</hi> to perpetuate the being and happiness of such a Creature, till (by some misdemeanour) it comes to <hi>forfeit its being</hi> and happiness; is to deny that God hath such power over his Creatures, as the Potter hath over the Clay, as Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> of the Covenant, <hi>p.</hi> 273. <q>withdraw that <hi>voluntary Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> and who doubteth not but that had the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture kept his Innocency a Thousand years, God was free to have annihilated him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed God cannot <hi>be injurious</hi> to his Creatures, because of his <hi>Essential Justice,</hi> which is <hi>instead of a Law</hi> to him, and is himself, neither can he be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden or <hi>properly indebted</hi> to his Creature; because
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:34554:26"/>of that <hi>infinite plenitude of perfection</hi> in himself, to which all the Creatures in the world, can make no <hi>Addition;</hi> as also because of his <hi>right</hi> and <hi>propriety</hi> in his Dominion and <hi>Authority</hi> over his Creatures. Thus Innocent <hi>Adam</hi> could never by the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, unsinning Obedience <hi>have merited in a strict sence;</hi> that is, in the way of <hi>commutative Justice,</hi> the continuation of his life and happiness. While he did only <hi>pay the debt,</hi> which was indispensibly owing to his Maker, it is most unreasonable to think, he could this way <hi>oblige</hi> God to him, make that God to whom all was due, his <hi>Debtor.</hi> Again, as (if <hi>Adam</hi> would merit) what he gave to God ought to have <hi>rationemindebiti,</hi> it must not be due before (which was otherwise, he could give to God no more than <hi>his own</hi>) so it should also have <hi>rationem Lucri,</hi> be some way profitable unto him, at whose hands he would <hi>merit.</hi> But who hath given to him, and it shall be recompenced to him again, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.35.</p>
               <p>Again, we may cast in this as <hi>Overplus,</hi> here was <hi>no proportion</hi> betwixt the <hi>work</hi> and the promised <hi>reward,</hi> what proportion betwixt a finite Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's giving up its self to the Service of its Maker, and God's giving back himself to be everlastingly enjoyed? What proportion betwixt a Creature's obedience, continued for a time, while he was in a <hi>probation-state,</hi> and God's remunerating it with happiness,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Coccei</hi> de <hi>faed.</hi> p. 35.</note> beyond time, even to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. <hi>Turpis Error est, promissiones dei nisi proportione officii.</hi> It was congruous to the Divine goodness indeed to promise so much to an innocent, and obedient Creature, it was <hi>a promise worthy of him</hi> that made it, though his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:34554:26"/>Obedience could not be properly <hi>worthy</hi> of that which was promised.</p>
               <p>So I conclude it was not of <hi>strict Justice,</hi> or natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Equity, but of grace and <hi>bounty,</hi> that God promised to Man's finite Service, and Obedience already due, a future, everlasting, infinite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>Now if innocent <hi>Adam</hi> could not properly be said to <hi>merit</hi> the promised <hi>reward,</hi> though he had performed unsinning obedience, how absurd is it to talk of the Saints meriting <hi>ex condigno</hi> by their <hi>imperfect</hi> Obedience, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.6. <hi>Shewing mercy to them that love me, and keep my Commandments.</hi> All that God doth for such, is of <hi>his mercy.</hi> Yet I do not deny, but that if <hi>Adam</hi> had obeyed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, it had been <hi>rewardable at the Bar of Gods distributive, legal Justice;</hi> as the obedience of the Faithful is <hi>rewardable at the Bar of Crace;</hi> but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the way of <hi>commutative Justice.</hi>

IX.</hi> Innocent <hi>Adam</hi> as he was bound, so he could not but <hi>accept of the</hi> Terms, or Condition, upon which God proposed, and promised the perpetuating of his happiness. And thus <hi>Man consenting</hi> to Gods terms, God and Man were formally and <hi>actually</hi> in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</head>
               <p>A <hi>Mutual Engagement</hi> of parties, is all that is essential to a Covenant. This is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt a Promise, and a Covenant.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Promise</hi> is that which bindeth one party <hi>singly;</hi> A <hi>Covenant</hi> is that wherein both parties are <hi>mutually</hi> bound.</p>
               <p>To the Covenant betwixt God and Man, it was no way necessary, that Man should <hi>indent</hi> with God, or make his own Terms; No, he was bound to <hi>accept</hi> of such <hi>Terms</hi> as it should please his Lord and Maker to set down, and offer; whatsoever God required of him, would bind him immediately, <hi>as a Law,</hi> without his consent, or liking of it. And
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:34554:27"/>before Man could have the liberty of making his own Terms with God, he must <hi>first satisfie</hi> and take off that <hi>Obligation</hi> on him, as a Creature to obey <hi>his Creator in all things,</hi> which Obligation a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can no way possibly take off, or be freed from, while he is a Creature.</p>
               <p>Thus in the Covenant betwixt God and Man, God is to <hi>propose</hi> the Terms, and Man is obliged to accept of them, as proposed by Him.</p>
               <p>In the first Covenant, the Covenant of Works, where the <hi>Condition</hi> was <hi>perfect Obedience;</hi> the Lord required no more, than what was due from Man, though God had not promised any further fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour thereupon.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>condescension</hi> being wholly on Gods part, in offering to enter into Covenant, and the <hi>benefit accrueing,</hi> or likely to accrew, being solely unto Man, it could not be <hi>just</hi> or <hi>reasonable,</hi> that Man should withhold or deny his consent.</p>
               <p>Thus Man at first was taken into Covenant with God, Man <hi>engaging to obey</hi> God in all things;

And that Pradice was to signifie <hi>Heaven;</hi> the tree of life to signifie eternal life to <hi>Adam,</hi> seemeth very plain; <hi>Heaven</hi> being called by the name of <hi>Paradice</hi> in Scripture. And the tree of life so called (as some
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:34554:28"/>good Expositors have noted) because it was to be a <hi>Symbole</hi> and <hi>Memorial</hi> to <hi>Adam</hi> as oft as he tasted, or beheld it, of his receiving his life and happiness from God, that he had not these in: and of <hi>himself.</hi> His eating of this tree was to be an Acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his dependance upon God for life and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, and, <hi>Se non propriâ virtute, sed Dei unius beneficio, vivere, &amp; perpetuò victurum, si obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diret,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Here by the way, observe, God thought not Sacraments useless to man in innocency. Yet some amongst us think themselves above Sacraments, and Ordinances, those means and helps God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed under the Covenant of Grace.</p>

Yet there seems to be some doubt, whether it be so rightly called the <hi>Covenant of Nature:</hi> Though the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> bound man to obey his Creator in all things, which was the same that the Covenant of works bound him to, that we must say the <hi>preceptive part</hi> of the Covenant was <hi>natural;</hi> yet I dare not say, that the <hi>Promissory part</hi> of the Covenant was so, that God was bound to promise all he did upon Man's Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, or bound to promise any thing at all; I say, it was not <hi>juris Naturalis,</hi> that God should make such a promise, I dare not say, that there was an intrinsecal, natural, necessary <hi>connexion</hi> betwixt a Creature's Obedience, and everlasting life and happiness; so that God had not been <hi>just,</hi> if <hi>(sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing) Adam</hi>'s Obedience continued a 1000 years, he had not thereupon <hi>confirmed</hi> his Creature in a state of endless happiness. If it had been injustice to have denyed such a reward to Man's Obedience, so that Man might have concluded upon it from a common <hi>natural principle</hi> (as that God cannot be unjust) then there was no need to have <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised</hi> it, or to have entered into Covenant about it; would God have made a Covenant to do that, which his <hi>Essential justice</hi> bound him to? If he was not bound in Justice, so to reward his Creature's Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, then it was his <hi>free goodness</hi> (or Grace) to promise, and Covenant to do it.</p>
               <p>Now let it be considered, if it was thus of Gods <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>condescension</hi> to enter into the first Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with Man, if it was doing more than he was bound to, then I say, let it be considered, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:34554:29"/>it be fair for any to censure him, as if he had been <hi>over-rigorous,</hi> had he dealt with any according to the terms of that Covenant, or that God could not have held men to it.</p>

               <p>THis new right was <hi>accumulative</hi> unto, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive, or exclusive of the Former right. Man's being obliged <hi>de novo</hi> to obey God, by what the Lord promised in the Covenant to do further for him; cannot take off, or <hi>cancel</hi> that Obligation on him from his Creation, from what God had done for him already.</p>
               <p>That I may say here (without contradicting the Apostle) The Law (<hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Law of Nature</hi>) which was in force (at <hi>least, in order of Nature</hi>) before the Covenant, the Covenant did not disanull it. My meaning is, Gods <hi>condescension</hi> in Covenanting with Man, did not derogate, or take off any thing
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:34554:30"/>from his <hi>Authority</hi> as Law-giver, Gods Law was still binding as a Law, as the <hi>Law of our Maker;</hi> otherwise it would follow, that Man being taken into Covenant with God, he could not properly be guilty of <hi>disobedience,</hi> no disobedience but is a repugnancy against <hi>the Law,</hi> or <hi>will of a Superior,</hi> whom we ought to obey.

               <p>But <hi>Adam</hi>'s offence, his breach of Covenant, was properly <hi>disobedience,</hi> Rom. 5.19. That the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with <hi>Adam,</hi> did not take from the force of the Law, which he was under, as a Creature; but indeed added this further <hi>aggravation</hi> to his sin, that it was not barely the <hi>transgression</hi> of Gods Law, but the <hi>violation</hi> of his <hi>Covenant:</hi> as it was an affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods <hi>Soveraignty</hi> and justice, (a dreadful thing indeed) so it was a notorious slighting of Gods wonderful <hi>condescending</hi> love and goodness, <hi>shameful ingratitude,</hi> to be abhorred.</p>
               <p>But this is a <hi>principle</hi> which it concerns us all to be very clear in, that God in entring into Covenant with Man, did not set aside his <hi>Autherity,</hi> did not cease to be man's Soveraign; no verily, while Man is <hi>his</hi> Creature, God cannot cease to be his <hi>rightful Governour,</hi> or the Law of God cease to bind Man to obedience, even because it is the Law of his Maker.</p>

                  <hi>PROP. XIII.</hi> As a clear and certain evidence, that God in Covenanting with man, did not lay down his <hi>Soveraignty</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> over him; He annexeth to his Law or Covenant the just threatning of a dreadful penalty, Death in case of disobedience. <hi>In the day thou eatest,</hi> (sinnest) <hi>dying thou shalt dye.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AS God hath first of all <hi>jus praecipiendi,</hi> a right of Commanding. So if his Commandments are not in every thing obeyed; he hath thereupon <hi>jus puniendi,</hi> a right of punishing. Where due Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is denyed to a <hi>Superior,</hi> much more where it is denyed unto him, who is the <hi>Supream,</hi> God over all, punishment is justly exacted, and righteously inflicted by him.</p>
               <p>Now there is a Question, when God threatned death to <hi>Adam,</hi> if he disobeyed, what <hi>kind of death</hi> it was, whether the same kind of death was threatned under the Covenant of works, as under the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I suppose the same kind of death threatned under both Covenants. If the same <hi>kind of life</hi> and happiness was promised under the Covenant of Works, as is promised under the Covenant of Grace, we may in reason conclude the <hi>same kind</hi> of death, and punishment was threatned in both
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:34554:31"/>Covenants. But the former would seem true as we heard before.</p>
               <p>Again, what think we? Do any suffer, as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to death <hi>by the Covenant</hi> of Works? If we suppose any sinners in the world proceeded against, and punished, as <hi>Violaters</hi> of that Covenant, we read no where in Scripture of two <hi>different Hells</hi> prepared, one for those that are guilty of breaking the <hi>first;</hi> the other, for such as are guilty of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the succeeding Covenant. We find the same <hi>Vengeance</hi> threatned to them that know not God, and to them that obey not the Gospel, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.8. The <hi>Sinners</hi> of <hi>Sodome</hi> suffer the <hi>Vengeance of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal fire,</hi> Judge <hi>v.</hi> 7. the same vengeance which is threatned to <hi>Sinners in Sion.</hi> I say the same punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for kind (<hi>i. e.</hi> Hell-Torments) though not the same <hi>degree</hi> of punishment; but if a different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of punishment should make a <hi>new kind of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,</hi> it seemeth to follow, that, since of those that sin against the Covenant of Grace, some sin more hainously than others, more openly and despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately <hi>than others</hi> contemn it, and therefore shall be thought worthy of much <hi>sorer</hi> punishment (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29.) so there should be divers kinds of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for the breakers of the Covenant of Grace, which I know none that will assert.</p>
               <p>Again, I suppose it will not be <hi>denyed,</hi> but belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are delivered by Christ's satisfaction from the condemnation of hell. As I suppose, it will not be <hi>affirmed;</hi> that Christ satisfyed for the <hi>penalty</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Covenant of Grace, properly as there threatned; but for that which was <hi>threatned</hi> and due to sinners <hi>under the Covenant</hi> of works. And so will it not follow, that the condemnation of Hell
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:34554:31"/>was threatned, and due to sinners under the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works.</p>
               <p>Only, one thing seemeth to make against this, <hi>viz.</hi> Supposing a <hi>temporal death</hi> or separation of Soul and Body, to be one thing included in the threatning here, <hi>[dying thou shalt dye]</hi> it would seem that the resurrection of the body is a <hi>proper fruit</hi> of Christ's death, and resurrection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.21, 22. And if there was to have been no <hi>resurrection</hi> of the body, had not Christ dyed and risen again, then it would follow, no such <hi>punishment</hi> could be threatned at first, as is now <hi>threatned</hi> to unbelievers, who are to be punished everlastingly both in Body and Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The fore-mentioned Text seems to speak of the <hi>resurrection unto life,</hi> the resurrection of those that are Christs, <hi>v.</hi> 23.</p>
               <p>Again, though Christ Mediator, be the cause of the resurrection of all (both just, and unjust) at the last day; yet it follows not, that there had been no resurrection, if Christ had not been given a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator; we know what he saith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.22.27. <hi>All judgment</hi> is now committed to the Son of Man, yet surely sinners should have <hi>been judged,</hi> though he had not been incarnate, had not been the Son of Man. <hi>Qui resurrectionem impiorum Christi m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rito attribuunt, ignorant hominem pro peccato &amp; tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralem, &amp; aeternam mortem in toto supposito perferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam debere,</hi> Coccei de Foed. c. 2. Sect. 2. p. 46.</p>
               <p>Another Question, whether the truly righteous man is awed with the threatning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> That the righteous ought to be awed with divine <hi>threatnings</hi> is very plain from hence, that <hi>righteous Adam</hi> was to make use of this threatning,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:34554:32"/>to keep him from sin. And the best of Saints while upon earth, are short of <hi>innocent Adam,</hi> many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees below him, being renewed and sanctified <hi>but in part,</hi> having but (as it were) a first draught of Gods Image, which <hi>Adam</hi> had compleat; But,</p>
               <p n="1">1, Some will say, Believers have <hi>no need</hi> of the threatnings to keep them from sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> What are they greater than our Father <hi>Adam,</hi> more perfect than <hi>Adam</hi> was in the state of integrity. He had need of the threatning, and his <hi>not attending</hi> to it so as he should have done, was a cause of his, and our sin and ruine.</p>
               <p>Again, why are there so many threatnings in the Word, directed to <hi>believers in special,</hi> if they are not to be heeded, and if such have no need of them? surely, the <hi>spirit of wisdom</hi> speaketh not in vain. Therefore said the <hi>Wisdom of God,</hi> Luk. 11.49. what the written word sayes, that the <hi>wisdom of God</hi> sayes; so God in his infinite wisdom, thought it <hi>needful</hi> to awe his people with threatnings, and not only to feed them with promises. Then can it be any other than folly for any to think, his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings needless, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>If you live after the flesh you shall dye.</hi> This is spoken to those, of whom he saith <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear,</hi> Heb. 10.38. <hi>The just shall live by Faith,</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>but if he draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.</hi> Parallel to <hi>Ez.</hi> 18.24 <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26, 27. If we sin <hi>wilfully</hi> after that we have received the Knowledge of the truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not that these Texts will prove <hi>the Apostacy of Saints;</hi> but only that upon supposition of their to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal sinal Apostacy, they should perish even as others. If you can suppose a Saint to <hi>fall away finally,</hi> I will
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:34554:32"/>suppose that Saint to fall into condemnation, and to perish everlastingly; and <hi>such threatnings</hi> are to caution them, as means appointed and blessed by God, to prevent their <hi>total Apostacy,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to prevent their Perdition too. And as one observes well, there is a threatning <hi>virtually</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in every promise. As when it is said <hi>[Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever endureth to the end shall be saved.]</hi> It implyeth that whosoever doth not endure, and hold out to the end, shall not be saved. But further some will say, <hi>Adam</hi> it's true might fall from the <hi>Condition of the Covenant of works,</hi> and so fall under the curse and threatning, but believers cannot fall from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Covenant of Grace, that they need not fear the threatning, seeing they cannot fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> That a Believers standing is surer than <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s was, it is not because he is <hi>stronger in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> for he is much weaker than <hi>Adam</hi> was; but because he hath those <hi>props</hi> and supports, which <hi>Adam</hi> had not in the state of his integrity. There is Gods immutable purpose and <hi>promise</hi> to uphold him, Christs undertaking, and interceeding for him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But as the Lord hath promised, the Elect shall persevere; so he hath <hi>provided</hi> means in order to it, (as was hinted before;) so he keepeth his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple close to himself, not only by <hi>working love,</hi> but also by putting an holy <hi>fear in their hearts,</hi> Jer. 32.40. <hi>I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.</hi> This may be set forth by a comparison which Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> hath, thus, <q>As a Child in his Fathers Arms threatned to be cast over a sharp rock into the Sea, may fear, and cry out for fear, and yet believe such is his Fathers
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:34554:33"/>love and compassion, that he will not throw him into the Sea, that the threatning is not intended to be executed; but to cause him to take faster hold, and clasp his Arms about his Father's Neck.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But here some again will say, to be awed with threatning, is <hi>slavish;</hi> this is from a Spirit of Bondage, and contrary to our acting out of love.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> We may see the contrary in <hi>Adam;</hi> He was to fear the threatning, yet was not of a <hi>slavish spirit,</hi> notwithstanding the threatning against dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, yet he obey'd in love too, while in the state of Integrity. So the Apostle sayes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. <hi>The love of Christ constraineth us,</hi> and in the same Chapter <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we perswade men.</hi> To <hi>Act only</hi> from fear, is the property of a <hi>slavish spirit indeed;</hi> but so on the other hand, to cast off all fear is the property of a vain, secure, and wanton spirit. But observe, we do not think it enough for men to act in Religion <hi>only from fear;</hi> you never hear us say (as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists) that Attrition, as distinct and separate from contrition; that sorrow for sin <hi>meerly</hi> for fear of hell, without any sorrow for it, as an offence against God, (if accompanied with confession to a Priest) is enough for ones Salvation.</p>
               <p>If that Text of the Apostle <hi>John</hi> 1 <hi>Epist.</hi> 4.18. be objected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Love here is not perfect, as it will be in the world to come.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By Fear (which love is said to cast out) the Apostle meaneth not a <hi>reverential fear of God,</hi> which quickeneth unto duty, and helpeth to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the heart aright in duty; but <hi>a slavish fear.</hi> Or,</p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:34554:33"/>
               <p n="3">3. He meaneth not the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> and of his wrath or displeasure, but the <hi>fear of man,</hi> of man's frowns, of man's rage. Indeed this hath torment in it; and greatly disquieteth, and disanimateth men, in whom it prevaileth.</p>
               <p>Briefly to dispatch this point, are we allowed to fear any thing? If any thing in the world be to be feared, surely then Gods wrath is to be feared, coming into the <hi>state of the damned,</hi> to be for ever deprived of, shut out of God's presence, and laid under his burning Indignation for ever, is a thing <hi>to be feared:</hi> not that believers should conclude <hi>posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,</hi> and absolutely of their falling into condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation (for there is <hi>no condemnation</hi> to them that are in Christ Jesus) but upon <hi>supposition;</hi> thus, If I live after the flesh, I shall dye. If I should <hi>draw back</hi> from Christ, it would be to my own perdition. If I should wickedly depart from God, forsake him, he would cast me off for ever. Pray Sirs think of it: Hath not God told us so much in his Word, and are we not bound to <hi>believe the truth</hi> of what he there declares? And if we are bound to believe these things to be true, are we not exceedingly to dread least they should <hi>be verified</hi> in us; how should we dread that course and state which we are sure to perish in, unless the Word of God prove false! And thus to <hi>apply</hi> the <hi>threatnings of the Word,</hi> is a <hi>good way to prevent the evil threatned.</hi> Such an Application of Divine threatnings tends to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote an <hi>holy care,</hi> which is a necessary <hi>duty,</hi> rather than to beget <hi>slavish fear,</hi> that Soul-<hi>misery.</hi> They that quite cast off these reins, which the Lord hath laid on us, to curb, and keep under our Corruptions, I should look for no other than that they would soon <hi>wax wanton,</hi> and kick against God.</p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:34554:34"/>
               <p>One consideration more, I cannot pass by; Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine threatnings shew us <hi>what Sin deserves,</hi> and the greater sense we have of our danger by sin, the more we shall <hi>prize redemption</hi> by Christ. The more we understand the desert of sin, the more we shall come to know our <hi>Obligation</hi> unto God, for pardoning grace. They are clearly <hi>mistaken</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that would not have believers hear the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the Word. Surely they do not understand themselves, that think this is a way to damp that <hi>Child-like love,</hi> the Gospel requires, rather a due consideration of Gods threatnings against Sin and Sinners, would help to <hi>raise</hi> a believers love to God, and Jesus Christ, and blow it into a greater <hi>flame,</hi> Mary <hi>loved much,</hi> because she had much forgiven. And the more we see what <hi>sin deserves,</hi> the better we shall know what it is to have sin <hi>forgiven,</hi> and the more we shall apprehend, what an Obligation lyeth on us, to love God that <hi>pardoneth our iniquities,</hi> and to love Jesus Christ, a dear Redeemer, upon whose account they are forgiven.</p>

                  <hi>PROP. XV.</hi> This Covenant therefore which God made with Man at first, was the perfect, <hi>Adaequate Rule,</hi> both of all which God then required of Man, and of what Man might expect from God. It contained the Rule of Man's <hi>Obedience,</hi> and the ground of his hopes.</head>
               <p>THe Stipulation or condition required, was no less than the <hi>whole duty</hi> of Man, obedience to the will of God in all things.</p>
               <p>The promise of life (belonging to this Covenant) included in it <hi>all good,</hi> agreeable to Man's present state, and everlasting happiness, at the end of Man's probation-state.</p>
               <p>The <hi>death threatned</hi> upon Man's disobedience, we see explained in part, what it was in those evils, which sin hath brought upon the world of Mankind, <hi>manifold miseries,</hi> in this life we feel; we all naturally fear, and look for temporal death. <hi>(The living know that they shall dye.)</hi> And which is inconceivably more, sin subjected to all <hi>miseries</hi> Spiritual, and Eternal.</p>
               <p>Thus the first Covenant determined both of Man's <hi>duty,</hi> and of his <hi>Condition,</hi> as to felicity, or misery, as to life or death, according as he performed, or failed in his duty. If he was Obedient in all things, then he was sure of life and happiness, if he failed in any the least point of <hi>Obedience required,</hi> then he
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:34554:35"/>could look for nothing, but to have the threatned <hi>penalty inflicted.</hi> Some find, as soon as <hi>Adam</hi> had sinned, he was <hi>afraid,</hi> and hid himself, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.20.</p>
               <p>But whether the threatning of the first Covenant did properly belong to it, as a Covenant, or a Law, I leave to others to determine.</p>

                  <hi>PROP. XVI.</hi> In this first Covenant there was neither <hi>need</hi> of, nor place for a Mediator.</head>
               <p>FIrst I say, there was no <hi>need</hi> of a Mediator here, at the making of this Covenant, God and Man were <hi>very good friends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, there was no <hi>place</hi> for a Mediator here. The condition required in this Covenant being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, <hi>personal</hi> obedience. If <hi>Adam</hi> obeyed not in his own person, this Covenant is broken, <hi>irreparably broken.</hi> And thus it becomes impossible that ever Man should attain to life and happiness <hi>by this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> if once he faileth in the least point of duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him, upon the least <hi>breach of Gods</hi> Law, he is immediately sentenced to death by the Tenor of this Covenant. And there is no thought of esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping condemnation in this case, except it please the Lord (of his infinite grace and mercy) to come upon <hi>new terms</hi> with Man.</p>
               <p>There is a Question whether Christ be not a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator on the behalf of the Angels that have kept their station.</p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:34554:36"/>
               <p>Some suppose Christ a Mediator to them, though not for <hi>reconciliation</hi> (that they acknowledge were needless, because there was never any breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and them.) Yet for <hi>confirmation;</hi> but there is no probability, that I can see in that opinion. It appears altogether improbable for the <hi>like reason</hi> to that now mentioned, upon which it will be granted, Christ is not to them a <hi>Mediator</hi> of <hi>recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation; viz.</hi> they need not such a Mediator. For if after such a <hi>tryal</hi> as the Lord would please to make of the obedience of Angels and Men, they were to be <hi>confirmed</hi> in their happiness and obedience for the future, to make good the promissory part of the Covenant of works, then there was no need of a Mediator for <hi>confirmation</hi> either of Angels or Men under the Covenant of works. His Creatures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation in a state of happiness (upon their good carriage in their <hi>probation-state</hi>) was <hi>Gods part</hi> of the Covenant, what he promised, and would have effected; no <hi>need</hi> of any to undertake for Gods part of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>That this was Gods part of the Covenant is clear. The creature was not to expect <hi>confirmation</hi> in hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, without performing the condition <hi>on his part,</hi> that is, carrying obediently, and as a creature ought to do in all respects towards its Maker <hi>in viâ,</hi> or in its state of probation. And this condition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing performed, God would never have failed to perform the promise <hi>on his part;</hi> that is, to confirm such a creature <hi>in patriâ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to say otherwise, that a Mediator was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for <hi>confirmation</hi> under the first Covenant, without whom, Man, or Angel could not persist in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, is <hi>interpretatively</hi> to deny, that they were
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:34554:36"/>created upright, and with sufficient Abilities to have kept upright; which is to suppose their fall was from a <hi>debility</hi> of Nature, from a want of some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward principle and help necessary to their standing, and not from <hi>the ill use of the</hi> liberty of their own wills. And this <hi>consequently</hi> denies the goodness of God, which he vouchsafed to these his creatures <hi>in special;</hi> denies what he did for them, making them after <hi>his own Image,</hi> and casts the fault upon God, that they fell necessarily, not being created with ability to stand.</p>
               <p>Again, suppose Christ a Mediator for <hi>confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> to undertake on the Creatures behalf, to help them to perform the condition; then it would seem strange, that Man was not <hi>confirmed.</hi> What? was Christ wanting, negligent, or unfaithful in his office? Surely no, therefore that Man was not <hi>confirmed,</hi> it seems sufficient to clear it, that Christ was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended of God to be a Mediator for confirmation to Angels, and Men, under the Covenant of works.</p>

                  <hi>PROP. XVII.</hi> God was under no tye, or Bond, to make Man <hi>immutably</hi> holy.</head>
               <p>IT is very unjust, and unreasonable, for any to complain, that God did not set Man in such a state at first, from whence he <hi>could not fall.</hi> That Man was endued with such power at first whereby he might have stood, and had stood (had he not been
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:34554:37"/>shamefully wanting to himself) this is, (no doubt) sufficient to vindicate the honour of his Maker, though he gave him not that <hi>special grace,</hi> from which one cannot fall.</p>
               <p>It is too much for a creature to be immutable <hi>in its own Nature.</hi> To suppose such a thing of Man, so far as this property and perfection reacheth, is to make Man <hi>equal</hi> unto God. Therefore though Man was created holy, yet was he mutable, his holiness such as might be lost.</p>
               <p>Now when God made Man upright, <hi>and then put him upon the tryal,</hi> whether he would stand upright, he did no injury to man at all, <hi>Quum Deus hominem permisit sibi, injuriam non fecit homini, sed gloriam suam asseruit sibi.</hi> Jun. Surely the Lord had done his part, enduing Man's soul with knowledge, <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> and holiness, engaging Man to himself by so many favours, as by so many <hi>strong Bands,</hi> which his goodness and bounty had laid on him, promulging, and making known his Law, the <hi>Rule</hi> Man ought to live and walk by, backing the same with a dreadful <hi>commination,</hi> to warn and deterre him from sin, and with a very ample <hi>promise</hi> to excite and encourage him to obedience. Thus no <hi>moral means</hi> were wanting, or denyed to Man's preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; what could Man <hi>reasonably</hi> have desired that God would do more for him; If now man miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth, the fault cannot be in his Maker, but in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. Had he used that power, and those <hi>means</hi> given him, as he might, and ought, he had been for ever happy. God did not deny him any thing, which was congruous to his present state. I know not how we can say that there was <hi>Gratiae substractio, [nam, ut vellet constanter non peccare, Nullam</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:34554:37"/>Adamus <hi>acceperat,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lapsus deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis, non de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertio lapsus causa fuit.</note>
                  <hi>ut autem posset non peccare si vellet vel nullâ indiguit, cum peccandi ratio in volendo sita sit, vel eâ non substractâ potuit peccare.</hi> Thes. Salmur. de laps. Ada. Sect. 25. p. 203.] God did not take from Man any ability to perform obedience, given him in his Creation; but only gave not in (as he was not bound) a new supply of further grace.</p>
               <p>Certainly, it was no hard or unjust thing, that God should <hi>try his Creatures obedience,</hi> who stood obliged to him by such wonderful tyes and <hi>engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi> and if God would try Man's obedience, Man is supposed not to be in a state of <hi>Impeccability:</hi> It would not have become the Divine Wisdom to give Man a <hi>Law purely for trial</hi> whether he would obey, if it was impossible for him to disobey.</p>
               <p>Thus indeed while Man was <hi>Viator,</hi> in a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion state, we must grant, he had a power to obey God in all things, and it was also possible for him to disobey.</p>
               <p>Yet observe this, there was <hi>no evil inclination,</hi> no propensity to sin in Man before, as is found in him now since his fall. That <hi>pronity,</hi> which is now in us all, to what is forbidden, is certainly sinful: that should we suppose any <hi>inordinate concupiscence</hi> natural to Man at his first Creation, it would infer, that he came sinful out of Gods hand. This would be <hi>to impute folly</hi> to our Maker, and make God the Author of Sin. In the regenerate there is a lusting of the <hi>Flesh against the Spirit;</hi> but in <hi>Adam</hi> there was no such lustings, and contrary inclinations (while he kept his innocency &amp; integrity) But his <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inclinations</hi> were in an absolute subjection to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:34554:38"/>right Reason, and the Rule which God his Creator had given him. As <hi>Aquinas</hi> sayes well, the Act of the concupiscible faculty is only so far to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>natural,</hi> as it is subject to right reason, when it rebels and transgresses the bounds of reason, then it is <hi>contra naturam,</hi> and <hi>Vulnus naturae.</hi> So this was not in Man before he sinned. That <hi>natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination</hi> in Man to eat of the fruits in Paradise, was <hi>Physically</hi> or <hi>Naturally</hi> Good, morally indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, neither good nor evil. It was in his Nature as convenient to it, being to live on the fruits of the Earth. But when God by a special <hi>positive Law</hi> had restrained Man's Natural liberty, forbidding him to eat of such a fruit, what might have been desired <hi>Naturally,</hi> and innocently before, cannot be desired now without sin; because Man is bound to <hi>subject</hi> all his desires to the Divine Will and Law. That he had a <hi>natural power</hi> of eating the forbidden fruit, was no way culpable, or sinful; but that he exerted this power against Gods Law.</p>
               <p>Now though a good account may be given, why Man was not created <hi>immutably</hi> good, he being at first in <hi>Statu viatoris, non comprehensoris,</hi> a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bationer for Heaven. And therefore his obedience being to be tryed; (though he had power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form <hi>sinless obedience,</hi> yet it was also possible for him to disobey) yet it will not follow, as (<hi>Corvinus</hi> would have it) that glorified Saints, who are <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensors,</hi> because they are fully confirmed in good, cannot properly be said to obey, or to be under any Law. [<hi>Ʋt verò liberum arbitrium tollatur ab eo, cui lex praescribitur, etiam fieri non potest, quia ubi illud non est legi locus non est, Quare etiam sequitur, iis
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:34554:38"/>qui jam in bono sunt confirmati, proprie Legem ferri non posse, neque item eos Deo obedire propriè dici posse,</hi> &amp;c. Corvin. Censur. Anat. c. 6 Sect. 1. p. 101.]</p>
               <p>This is <hi>strange Divinity</hi> sure; though it would seem needless that such as are confirmed in a state of happiness and perfection, should be under any <hi>Law meerly for tryal.</hi> (It would be <hi>Actum agere,</hi> to give them such a Law, which the wisdom of God would not do.) Yet it will not follow, that therefore they are <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.</hi> And if they cannot be said properly to obey,
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ergo, inquam, is non vult qui non potest non velle; tu ergo, ne vis quidem tibi esse bene, quia non potes velle tibi esse Male.

Camero Defens. c. 12. p. 205.</note> why are we directed to pray, that the will of God may be <hi>done on earth,</hi> as it is in Heaven? why are they made patterns of obedience to us? But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that Angel, who was sent <hi>Acts</hi> 12. to deliver <hi>Peter</hi> out of Prison, had refused (<hi>Jonahs</hi> like) to go, when God sent him; would it not have been proper <hi>disobedience?</hi> And what reason can be given, but that his going upon Gods errand was an Act of <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this further, Jesus Christ who was anointed with the oyle of gladness <hi>above</hi> his fellows, to whom God gave not the Spirit <hi>by measure,</hi> was certainly as much confirmed in Good, as any Saint or Angel in Heaven can be; yet who can have a <hi>face to deny,</hi> that he truly obeyed? <hi>Obedientia non est necessitatis, sed libertatis.</hi> says <hi>Corvinus.</hi> We say though obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience cannot be both free and <hi>forced,</hi> yet it may be free and <hi>necessary</hi> too. It may be in some respect necessary, and yet most free. Saints and Angels in Heaven <hi>cannot but love</hi> God, they see so much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:34554:39"/>and amiableness in him, for which they <hi>must love</hi> him to eternity; and yet they love him most freely. As on the contrary, the Devils sin neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily, can do no other, through that insuperable Malice and Wickedness which acteth them, yet they sin freely. According to <hi>Corvinus</hi> his way of reasoning, the weak, imperfect, obedience of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, should be <hi>more perfect</hi> obedience, and more worthy to be called obedience, than that of Angels, and <hi>Spirits of just men made perfect;</hi> which soundeth strangely. As if that obedience was not most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that had <hi>most of the will</hi> in it. But I forget my self.</p>

               <p>These with many other sins, were contained in the first <hi>Transgression.</hi>

               <p>One more I must not let pass un-named, <hi>viz.</hi> that it was a direct <hi>breach of Covenant.</hi> Breach of Covenant with God, horrid perfidiousness, not meerly the breach and transgression <hi>of Gods Law;</hi> but also the violation of his Covenant, and so a shameful requital of Gods gracious condescention. Had it been an <hi>enemy</hi> or a <hi>stranger,</hi> that had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it thus, there had been less of wonder &amp; strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in it; but that a friend, and a confederate should deal so treacherously with God, may not Heaven and Earth be astonished at this?</p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:34554:40"/>
               <p>This (I say) was a direct breach of Covenant with God, an <hi>irreparable</hi> breach of that Covenant. An utter renouncing of it. As it was a breach of that Law, God had given to be the <hi>Test of Man's obedience</hi> (&amp; perfect obedience was the condition of the first Covenant) so it was as an open profession of <hi>disobedience,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>It was the transgression of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept which God had given for the trial of Man's obedience, and so was an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute denial of subjection, &amp; renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of obedience; as the observance of it had been an open profession of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission and due obedience.</hi> Ball <hi>of</hi> Meditation. <hi>p.</hi> 213. 214.</note> and declared <hi>renouncing</hi> of his Covenant.</p>
               <p>I know it is a great Question, how our first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents could so strangely <hi>overshoot</hi> themselves?</p>
               <p>But that they did so, is plain, and out of Question. Some Question whether the sin <hi>of pride,</hi> or incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity was first in the fall of our first Parents? But me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks we must conceive them something <hi>declined from God,</hi> and their duty, before they could be guilty of either that <hi>pride,</hi> or incredulity. So it would seem that <hi>incogitancy,</hi> and not retaining God in their thoughts, as they ought to have done, was the <hi>first step</hi> to their ruine.

                  <hi>PROP.

               <p>THe condition of the Covenant of works being nothing less than <hi>perfect obedience,</hi> one sin violates it on mans part, as well as a Thousand. Thus by one <hi>Act</hi> of disobedience man quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited all his right and title to all good and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which he had in present possession, or hoped for in regard of Gods promise, by one act of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience he brought himself <hi>under the curse.</hi> That according to the Tenor of this Covenant, after once he had sinned, he could no more expect <hi>any good</hi> at Gods hands for ever. And thus by sin man ruined himself, cast himself out of <hi>Gods favour,</hi> of a friend made himself an enemy, became subject to Divine wrath and vengeance, to all the miseries of this life, to death spiritual, and temporal, and eternal.</p>
               <p>Here I may speak something to the Question, How far the Covenant of works is abrogated?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Here I fear not to assert, that we are all still <hi>bound</hi> to what the Covenant required; that is,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:34554:41"/>to obey perfectly, though we are not <hi>bound</hi> up <hi>to it;</hi> that is, so bound up as to fall under the Sentence of Death unavoidably, and to have no hope of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, if we do not obey perfectly. I say we are not thus <hi>bound up</hi> to it; because there is a new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant set on foot. But that in some sence it is still in force, we must all grant, as roundly and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently as some assert the repealing, and nulling of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As concerning the <hi>preceptive part,</hi> what God required of Man in that Covenant; it was no other than the Law <hi>of his Creation.</hi> As we are Men, as we are reasonable creatures, it is our indispensible duty to obey God in all things. I say by the <hi>Law of Creation</hi> we are bound to obey God in all things; and that Law continues to oblige us, so long as we are creatures.</p>
               <p>Some tell us believers are freed not only from the <hi>condemning,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mar. of Mal. die.</hi> p. 148.</note> but from the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding power</hi> of the Covenant of works. Now I would ask such, Is it not every Man's duty still to obey God in all things? If so, then by what Law? Doth the <hi>Law of Faith</hi> insist upon perfect obedience? Or is not this the demand of the <hi>Law of works?</hi> Though we are not bound to keep the Law of God in all things <hi>necessitate medii,</hi> as the condition of life, yet we are bound <hi>necessitate prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepti,</hi> so that we sin whensoever we transgress it in any thing: And either believers are under the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding power</hi> of the Law, requiring perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, (though Christ hath power again, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his <hi>superadded Law of Grace,</hi> to suspend and take off the Penalty) or they do not sin, in not yielding perfect obedience, and so <hi>need no pardon.</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:34554:42"/>Where there is no Law, there is no transgression; and where is no transgression, there needeth no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. So Christ should not have <hi>procured pardon</hi> for the sins of believers, but rather this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>exemption</hi> from the <hi>strict Obligation</hi> of the Law, that what are sins in others, are no sins in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. If it be said, the Law requiring perfect obedience is <hi>still in force,</hi> but only as it is <hi>in the hand of Christ.</hi> I answer, it did not cease to be Gods Law, in becoming the Law of Christ.</p>
               <p>But thus you must say, the preseptive part of the Covenant of works (being the Law of Man's Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation) is still <hi>in force.</hi> It being eternally the bounden duty of a Creature to obey its Maker in all things.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the <hi>minatory</hi> part as it threatned death to every sin, determined and declared the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to sin and sinners. (And a threatning <hi>as a threatning,</hi> doth no more, doth not necessarily predict the event) we must say this is still in force, or deny that sin <hi>now deserves</hi> legally what God threatned unto <hi>Adam.</hi> It is a very gross mistake for any to think that the sins of believers do not <hi>deserve hell</hi> and wrath. The <hi>reatus simplex,</hi> a due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of punishment to sin, is ever inseperable from sin. And so by the <hi>Old Original Law,</hi> that punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is due to the person of the sinner Only here steps in a <hi>Remediant Law,</hi> a Law of Grace, that sayes, if thou art a true believer, if thou art one that truly repents, the punishment is not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon thee; for Christ hath <hi>satisfyed,</hi> and his satisfaction God hath accepted for thee; But I pray mark it, if the old Original Law be not in force, to <hi>charge guilt upon us,</hi> we have no need of a discharge
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:34554:42"/>in, and from the Gospel, what need of a discharge from that, which <hi>no Law can charge</hi> us with? so we must say, a believer hath no sins to be pardoned. For a pardon does necessarily and essentially import <hi>a dissolving of the Obligation to punishment.</hi> Now there can be no Obligation to punishment, where the penal Law is no more in force: And where there can be no <hi>Obligation</hi> to punishment, there cannot be properly any dissolving of that Obligation; and so properly there can be no pardon.</p>
               <p>Thus you see to what issue the matter is brought, if we should deny the old Law <hi>in force,</hi> as threatning death to every sin, <hi>scil.</hi> consequently we deny that there can be such a thing as pardon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As to the promissory part of the Covenant of works, or Law of Innocency, that cannot be said to be <hi>abrogated,</hi> but only <hi>ceaseth, cessante capacitate subditi,</hi> since the fall Man is no capable subject. For a Man to be a sinner, and yet to be capable of claiming life and happiness by the <hi>Law of Innoceucy,</hi> is indeed a plain contradiction. Such a Law, or Covenant, when once the condition becomes <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally impossible</hi> (as learned Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> somewhere noteth) <hi>transit in Sententiam,</hi> it ceaseth to promise in this case, and instead of that, <hi>passeth Sentence</hi> upon men. Yet cannot sinners blame God, that righteousness and life come not this way, as if the failure was in his promise. No, it is in themselves, their not answering the condition; when Christ (a <hi>capable subject</hi>) came, the <hi>Law of innocency justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> him, and so it would justifie us, supposing we were, and did all, which the Law requireth. So much seemeth to be implyed in that speech of our Saviour to one that desired to <hi>justifie himself,</hi> (saying,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:34554:43"/>
                  <hi>what shall I do to inherit Eternal life,</hi> whereupon, Christ to give him enough, referreth him to the Law, [This do, <hi>(obey perfectly)</hi> and thou shalt live.] <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.25.28. not that any man ever did, or ever can attain to life and happiness <hi>by the works of the Law.</hi> Certainly, the <hi>Romanists</hi> are quite mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken in the scope of our Saviour's speech here, who cry out, <q>Hear, O ye <hi>Lutherans,</hi> the Lord Christ saith not, <hi>Crede &amp; vives: sed, fac hoc,</hi>
                  </q> Not [believe, and live] but [do this, and live.] Daring wretches, that to stablish their own <hi>proud Opinions,</hi> would have Jesus Christ to contradict himself. Rather the design of our Saviour's speech was to convince a man of his <hi>own inability,</hi> to save himself. And yet this seemeth to be implyed in it, that if there was any one in the world,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lex non falso sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutem promittit suis cultoribus, si quis plene obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet quicquid.</hi> Mandat. Coelo.</note>
                  <hi>every way such</hi> as the Law of God requireth to be, suppose such an one as is failing and deficient in nothing, and then <hi>[Do this, and live]</hi> would entitle him to life and happiness, such an one should attain to happiness without Christ, or pardoning grace, in as much as he had no need of a pardon. But seeing it is <hi>naturally impossible,</hi> that sinners (and we are all sinners) should ever attain to the condition of the Covenant of works, which is <hi>full conformity</hi> and perfect Obedience to Gods will, therefore that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is indeed <hi>ceased</hi> as to us.</p>
               <p>But to think that Man's sin could abrogate the Covenant, that God had made, is very unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. As if a man could satisfie and <hi>discharge</hi> a Bond by <hi>forfeiture.</hi> As if a subject by breaking the Law, could make himself <hi>lawless.</hi> He may thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:34554:43"/>himself of the benefit &amp; <hi>protection</hi> of the Law, it's true, but cannot exempt himself <hi>from the Duty of Subjection</hi> to it. Again, to think that God would abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate it, and take Man's failing in his duty, as a ground of excusing him from his duty, is as unreasonable. Then might one not have said, <hi>Noli ergo imperare,</hi> now give up the Government of the world.</p>
               <p>Again, to think that Christ would give himself, and improve his interest for the abrogation of it, would be an unworthy reflection on him. As if in his office and undertaking, as <hi>Mediator,</hi> he had not carried <hi>equally,</hi> indifferently consulting the Interests <hi>of both parties,</hi> with the like real tenderness. As if he had not been as true to his <hi>Father's honour,</hi> in preserving his right in, and authority over his creatures, as to his <hi>peoples safety;</hi> but did too partially incline to us, though the <hi>offending party.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was enough for the <hi>securing</hi> of the salvation, and happiness of his redeemed ones, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a <hi>new Law of Grace</hi> written in his own blood, <hi>[That all that believe in him should be justified, and saved,]</hi> notwithstanding the old Original Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued still in force.</p>
               <p>Nay, I tell you Christians, this does advance and set forth the <hi>free Grace</hi> of God, and exalt the praise and merits of your Redeemer; that <hi>for his sake,</hi> your sincere, though weak, imperfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is accepted, from whom yet <hi>perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> is is as due to God, as from any; and that for his sake your sins are pardoned, which are <hi>as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly sins,</hi> and as truly deserve hell and wrath as the sins of any.</p>
               <p>Thus I say, there is no reason to think, the <hi>first Original Law</hi> is made void by the after remediant
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:34554:44"/>Law. For both may stand in force together; as that strict Law given to the Common-wealth of the <hi>Jews,</hi> for <hi>putting Transgressors to death;</hi> to which was superadded this Law of Grace, that in such and such cases the Law-giver, the Rector did admit of a <hi>Commutation,</hi> that upon offering a Beast in Sacrifice, the Transgressor's life should be spared <hi>(though for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited by the Law)</hi> Lev. 5.17, 18. So this Original Law, whosoever stands indebted to another, shall satisfie his Creditor, or be liable to <hi>an arrest,</hi> and to be cast into Prison, remains in force; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing we suppose such a <hi>relieving Law</hi> as this made afterwards, That if any person in Debt, shall serve in the Wars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> while they are so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for the publick, they shall be <hi>protected</hi> from any arrest. These instances may help to clear the Question I am upon, especially the former.</p>
               <p>Many think, that because the Law of works serves not to the same <hi>use and end,</hi> for which it was given to Man in the state of Integrity, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it must needs be <hi>abrogated,</hi> that we are no more obliged by it. Not considering that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why righteousness and life cannot come by the Law, is not any <hi>weakness in the Law,</hi> but our weakness and incapacity to fulfil it. The Law of <hi>Ceremonies</hi> indeed cannot justifie, because of <hi>its weakness. (For it is not possible, that the blood of Bulls and Goats, should take away sins,</hi> Heb. 10.4.) But the <hi>Law of righteousness,</hi> which I am speaking of, were it not for Man's weakness, would justifie. Therefore that we cannot be justifyed by the Law of works now, let us not lay the fault on the Law, but on our selves.</p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:34554:44"/>
               <p>Truely, I cannot but wonder at some, that would have this a Question <hi>of great difficulty,</hi> but of little moment whether the Law of works, given to <hi>Adam,</hi> continue in force to all Mankind; methinks it is of very <hi>great moment,</hi> so that if we suppose the abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of it, we give the Antinomian no little Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. And methinks it is very plain, that it must continue to bind Man (obedience to God in all things being no more than he is <hi>for ever obliged</hi> to, as he is a creature) though for non-performance of such obedience as that Law requires, God is not <hi>bound</hi> to Man by that Law.</p>
               <p>I conclude therefore the Law of works is still in force, that none of us can say, If we obey God sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, we <hi>pay him all we owe,</hi> he requires no more; we cannot say that our sins do not <hi>legally deserve</hi> Eternal death; but only that though the Law of God looks upon us as sinners, <hi>and condemns our sins,</hi> as well as the first sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> yet this we may plead against the <hi>Execution</hi> of the sentence, and <hi>condemnation</hi> of the Law. There is also <hi>a new Law of Grace,</hi> an Act of General <hi>Indempnity</hi> and Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion which Christ hath procured, which God hath <hi>passed,</hi> that frees us from the curse and penalty of our sins, <hi>if we repent, believe, obey</hi> the Gospel, <hi>i. e.</hi> if we lay hold on the Grace offered to us, with an unfeigned desire and resolution to live and be, as this Grace that bringeth Salvation teacheth us.</p>

But the meaning is, thou mayest not eat, it shall not <hi>be lawful</hi> for thee; so neither are we to understand the <hi>threatning, [in the day thou eatest, dying, thou shalt dye]</hi> as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of what should immediately come to pass. <hi>Nec enim statim mortuus Adamus est,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Whittak. <hi>de Peccat.</hi> Orig. <hi>p.</hi> 39.</note>

               <p>Though I grant, as soon as Man had sinned, he became mortal, and <hi>began to dye,</hi> yet the threatning, <hi>as a threatning,</hi> does not foretell certain matter of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:34554:45"/>event; but only <hi>declare</hi> what <hi>punishment</hi> was <hi>due.</hi> And suppose the Death threatned here, was to have been <hi>immediately inflicted,</hi> as soon as our first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents had sinned, then there had been no <hi>natural ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</hi> Then the guilt and punishment had no way reached his Posterity; because so he should have had no posterity.</p>
               <p>Here you may observe a great difference between a <hi>threatning</hi> and a <hi>promise;</hi> he who hath a promise made to him, may lay claim to the thing promised; he hath a right by vertue of the promise. Men sometimes <hi>sue upon a promise,</hi> and Justice gives them the thing <hi>in kind,</hi> or <hi>value,</hi> the promise being proved; one is <hi>bound to do,</hi> as he promiseth, not alwayes to do as he threatneth. There may be reason to <hi>relax</hi> the <hi>punishment,</hi> that was threatned. A <hi>Rector</hi> that hath power in his Laws to set down and determine what punishment shall be due to the Transgressors; he hath also power <hi>above the Law</hi> in some cases to respite, or take off the punishment; otherwise there could be no such thing <hi>as Pardon.</hi> No Rector can be said to pardon an offender, but when he remits the punishment <hi>legally due.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet I grant, it becomes not <hi>the Wisdom</hi> of a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour to relax his Laws (supposing them good and Just) to remit the penalty lightly, or without <hi>good consideration;</hi> for so the Law would soon lose its Authority; Men would be imboldened to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress, the end of Government would not be carried on. It is a <hi>clear case,</hi> that God the righteous Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the world, would not remit the penalty without a <hi>most valuable consideration;</hi> as Christ must dye in our stead.</p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:34554:46"/>
               <p>And one thing further must be granted, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times threatnings do not only declare <hi>meritum paenae in peccante, &amp; jus puniendi in comminante,</hi> a desert of punishment in him that offends, and a right of punishing in him that commandeth and threatneth; but also the <hi>irrevocable decree,</hi> &amp; purpose of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor to inflict the said punishment. Thus God threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Eli</hi> &amp; <hi>his house, Ahab</hi> &amp; his house; thus the sin &amp; blasphemy against the Holy Ghost is threatned; and so all that continue <hi>finally impenitent</hi> and unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are threatned: Such threatnings are not a meer <hi>Sanction of the precept,</hi> but a signification, or Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Gods purpose, shewing not only what he <hi>justly may, but what peremptorily</hi> he <hi>will</hi> inflict.</p>

               <p>HAd he kept his Integrity he should have begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Children, not in a state of sin, but in a state of innocency: The Image of God, that Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal righteousness which was <hi>concreated</hi> with him, should have been conveyed and derived from him to his Children, together with other <hi>blessed privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi> appertaining to that state.

And it is impossible that there should be a Covenant made between two, when one of the parties knows nothing of it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But it is neither impossible, nor unequal to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve and include Children <hi>in Covenant</hi> with their Parents, when they understand nothing of it. They are parts and <hi>appendices</hi> of the Parents, and at their Parents dispose, before they know how to dispose of themselves. And who questioneth but in <hi>taking a Lease</hi> one may by Covenant bind not only him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but his Children after him to <hi>certain Terms,</hi> which yet the Child knoweth nothing of? And did
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:34554:47"/>not that Covenant which <hi>Moses</hi> made betwixt the Lord, and the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> Deut. 29. take in their <hi>little ones,</hi> v. 10, 11, 12.

               <p>As to that plea, <q>[It would not be equal, if the posterity had not <hi>caution given</hi> what they might suffer by the breach of the Covenant, and ability given to prevent the evil]</q> that this is a <hi>meer flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,</hi> a sound of words without any strength of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, is thus demonstrated, <hi>viz.</hi> This would make as much against <hi>Gods decree</hi> concerning <hi>Adam</hi>'s posterity, as against the Covenant with him, and his posterity.</p>
               <p>Now it is <hi>granted on all hands</hi> (and this learned writer will not deny) that the Posterity of <hi>Adam</hi> have lost and suffered much by the fall.

               <p>But that you may understand what Man's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is by Nature, through the fall of our first Parents.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Take notice, that <hi>Adam</hi> by his fall lost his Original rectitude, and became universally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved in the whole Man; see the <hi>blindness of his
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:34554:48"/>mind,</hi> together with crookedness of will, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order of affections, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.8. When they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the Garden in the cool of the day, <hi>Adam</hi> and his wife hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the presence of the Lord God, among the trees of the Garden. And if they had not thought of God, till they heard of him, where was Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? In a dead sleep sure. And was not their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <hi>now darkned,</hi> darkned with a witness, when they thought <hi>to hide themselves</hi> from Gods presence among the trees? But whether can a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture flee from his presence? Again, how strangely were their <hi>wills perverted,</hi> and affections disordered, who now exceedingly dread, and cannot <hi>endure the presence</hi> of God; whereas, before they had sinned, he was accounted the <hi>chiefest good,</hi> they could not but have delighted in his presence before, as their highest happiness.</p>
               <p>And what was <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall but <hi>a turning from God</hi> to the Creature, preferring the lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life before God and happiness; preferring a false <hi>seeming good</hi> before the chiefest good.

And therefore when Man turned from God the <hi>chiefest good,</hi> to a false good, being led away with his sensitive appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, (through his own incogitancy, and the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's subtilty) there upon he became <hi>animalis home,</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:34554:48"/>wholly carnal; I say, thus he became a vain, sensual, carnal man. Hence came that woful disorder into his Soul. All things turned <hi>upside</hi> down with him. The sensitive appetite, (which was the lower fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, inferior to the will, and understanding, and <hi>to be ruled</hi>) came to rule in Man, the other powers loving and liking to have it so. Thus the <hi>nearest end</hi> of the lowest faculty (as things of sence) the things of the flesh, the having and enjoying of those things, became the last and <hi>highest end</hi> of the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior faculties. What horrible confusion was here brought into Man's Nature by sin? That if you look upon him in a <hi>Moral consideration,</hi> he was no longer such a Creature as God made him, but quite another thing; though he had the same <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> faculties after his fall as before, yet the <hi>moral qualities</hi> of those faculties were not the same, but directly contrary. God made <hi>man upright,</hi> with an appetite in perfect subjection to right reason, with a clear understanding of the <hi>chiefest good,</hi> with a will sweetly closing with that good; but when through inadvertency (as I said before) he fell from God to a <hi>false good,</hi> all these faculties were immediately corrupted, and depraved, the rectitude of them quite lost.</p>
               <p>If any one should say here, but as <hi>Adam</hi> when he fell, turned <hi>from God</hi> to the Creature, and to a false good; might he not of himself turn from that false good unto God again?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> No, not of himself, when he hath lost that rectitude of Soul, which is absolutely necessary to ones <hi>chusing God,</hi> and taking him for his last end and chiefest good; nor is the case alike: It is easie for one to fall, or cast himself down from an high
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:34554:49"/>pinacle, not so easie for him to rise again, when by that fall he hath broke all his bones.

               <p>That the corruption of Nature is propagated unto all, that <hi>naturally descend</hi> from him, is very evident. <hi>Adam</hi> had lost Gods Image, and was corrupted, and sinfully enclined, when he is said to have begotten a Son in his <hi>own Image,</hi> Gen. 5.3. observe, the Scripture opposeth the <hi>Image of Adam</hi> to the <hi>Image of God,</hi> Eph. 4 22.24. to the <hi>Image of Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.47, 48, 49. what is <hi>Adam</hi>'s Image, but the <hi>flesh,</hi> Joh. 3.6. <hi>the Old man,</hi> Col. 3.9.

               <p>Again, how plain is that of our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.6. <hi>That which is born of the flesh is flesh.</hi> By this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument he there proves the necessity of <hi>regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> of a new birth, without which there is no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into the Kingdom of God. For that which is <hi>born</hi> of the flesh is flesh, as <hi>Job</hi> 14.4. <hi>Who can bring a clean thing out of an anclean?</hi> The answer is, <hi>not
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:34554:49"/>one.</hi> No man can do this. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>By one Man's disobedience many were made</hi> (constituted) <hi>sinners. [Many]</hi> Some would have the Apostle speak thus, <hi>cautelously,</hi> because that all simply and absolutely were not made sinners by <hi>Adam. Eve</hi> was a sinner, yet not made so by <hi>Adam</hi>'s means; she was <hi>first</hi> in the transgression. <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> the Son of God, was made Man; yet was not a sinner. But admitting these two <hi>special exceptions,</hi> the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> here, these <hi>[many]</hi> are as much <hi>as all,</hi> v. 12. The <hi>All</hi> here meant indeed, were <hi>many,</hi> and the many here spoken of were <hi>all.</hi> But the word [many] seems to be used here, because it was to come in again in the other part of the <hi>comparison.

                  <q>I was troubled with an <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> lately, for it being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to me; why it is to be believed that the sin of <hi>Adam</hi> could spoil <hi>the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man,</hi> and yet the Nature of Devils could not be spoiled by their sin, which was worse, I could not tell what to say, and therefore held my peace.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But methinks one need not study much for an answer to it. The Devils were not the <hi>root and fountain</hi> of other Spirits. God did not say to them, as to our first Parents <hi>[Encrease and Multiply.]</hi> But Man being to propagate his kind, it seemeth not so unaccountable, (once supposing our <hi>first Father</hi> to have sinned away Gods Image, that his

                  <hi>Obj.</hi> If all descending from <hi>Adam</hi> be corrupted, how was Christ Jesus clear from Native corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? was he not conceived, and born of a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Adam?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> All that descend from <hi>Adam</hi> by <hi>Natural Generation</hi> (the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> not excepted) derive Natural corruption from <hi>Adam.</hi> But Christ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended not from <hi>Adam</hi> by <hi>Natural Generation,</hi> his Generation and conception was <hi>miraculous.</hi> He came into the world, not by vertue of that primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>benediction [Increase and Multiply]</hi> but to make good that special promise <hi>[The seed of the Woman shall break the Serpents head.]</hi> He was that seed of the Woman conceived by the <hi>power of the Holy Ghost</hi> in the womb of a Virgin; and so the <hi>Holy One</hi> indeed, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.35, This very much <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms</hi> the truth of the point I am upon, <hi>scil.</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of Natural corruption to all that <hi>naturally
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:34554:50"/>descend</hi> from <hi>Adam,</hi> that Jesus Christ to free him from the said pollution, must not come into the world by <hi>Natural Generation,</hi> but by a most mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous conception.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But you will not deny, but <hi>Adam</hi> after his Fall was restored by Repentance, and renewed by Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Grant him to be renewed, sanctifyed, yet it was but <hi>in part,</hi> that he had Gods Image restored in him. And this, of Gods wonderful <hi>special Grace,</hi> and therefore it was not a quality that was naturally to descend. When he begat a Son, he did this, <hi>as a man,</hi> not as one renewed and created again. He begat a Son after his <hi>own Image,</hi> that is, sinful like himself; not <hi>after Gods Image,</hi> which in man's lapsed state, is purely supernatural.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But you cannot tell how this Natural cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is conveyed from the Parent to the Child.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Nor do we know <hi>how the bones do grow in the womb</hi> (Eccl. 11.5.) <hi>of her that is with Child.</hi> But we must not deny <hi>that which is plain,</hi> because we cannot understand that which <hi>is difficult.</hi> We have seen plain Scripture for the derivation of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption from <hi>Adam</hi> to us all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But may not the Scripture mean, we are made sinners by <hi>imitation</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> rather than by the propagation of corruption from him? May we not understand it thus, that we are corrupted by his evil Example?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> No, That were not to interpret but to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Scripture. That which is <hi>born of the flesh is flesh.</hi> Does not this speak plainly of Natural Generation, and nothing of <hi>imitation.</hi> So <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.5. <hi>Behold I was shapen in iniquity, and in Sin did my
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:34554:51"/>Mother conceive me.</hi> Certainly, <hi>David</hi> is here confessing <hi>his own sin.</hi> Not the sin of his Parents, but that which he had cause to be ashamed of, and humbled for, as <hi>his own Sin,</hi> not anothers. So that Text <hi>[by the Disobedience of one many were made sinful]</hi> If it meant by <hi>imitation</hi> only, then it should have been said, that we were made sinful by the Serpent, by Satan, or by the Woman, <hi>Eve,</hi> rather than by <hi>Adam;</hi> or why is the speech limited to the disobedience <hi>of one,</hi> when the world is full of pernicious examples; great multitudes there are, that draw others to sin by their <hi>evil Examples.</hi> And multitudes that are drawn to sin this way, who never read or heard of <hi>Adam.</hi> And those that have heard of <hi>his sin,</hi> have also heard of his <hi>punishment;</hi> that should rather deterre them from sin. And plain experience shews, that not his particular example, which is so <hi>remote;</hi> but nearer examples have the most malignant influence upon men. And that Children in the most <hi>religious</hi> families, where are the best precepts, and examples both, do bewray <hi>corruption of Nature,</hi> as soon as ever they can put forth any Acts of reason. Oh what <hi>strangers</hi> are they in <hi>Israel,</hi> yea, strangers in the world, yea, strangers to their own hearts, that see not the <hi>first rise</hi> of sin and wickedness that is in the world since the Fall, to be from an <hi>evil inclination</hi> within men, and not from an observation and imitation of others. And I know not well, what can be replyed to that, if we are made sinful by the disobedience of one <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> only by <hi>imitation,</hi> then may we not be said (by a parity of reason) to be made righteous by the Faith of one <hi>Abraham,</hi> we walking in the steps of his Faith?</p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:34554:51"/>
               <p n="3">3. The next thing I would clear to you is, That this Natural inherent pravity, or Original corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is <hi>sinful.</hi> It makes us really guilty before God, obnoxious to his wrath and curse for ever. I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely wave speaking of the <hi>guilt of</hi> Adam<hi>'s first transgression,</hi> the imputation of it to his posterity immediately, and antecedently, or <hi>irrespectively</hi> to this corruption of Nature, propagated from him, leaving it to the sober consideration and discussion of the Godly-learned.</p>
               <p>But though we hold <hi>Adam</hi>'s sin propagated, <hi>Non peccatum personae, sed peccatum Naturae;</hi> not his personal sin, not the transient action; but the sin of the Nature of Man, the corrupting of his Nature; for so it was an inherent, permanent, <hi>Evil quality:</hi> this alone sufficeth to condemn any one in the world. In regard of this inherent pravity and corruption, which is in every one from his <hi>very birth,</hi> yea, from his very quickning in the womb; we all deserve death and condemnation, deserve to be <hi>dealt withal</hi> and punished, after the same manner, as if we had done what our first Parents did.</p>
               <p>Now this is very plain and evident from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. and were <hi>by Nature Children of wrath,</hi> even as others. Nothing but sin could sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject us to Gods wrath, to which yet we are all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious by <hi>Nature,</hi> one as well as another. And if obnoxious to Gods wrath by Nature, then <hi>sinful</hi> by Nature. So that there is sin and guilt in our very Nature, before ever we come to the practice and commission of sin.</p>
               <p>Again, what an undeniable proof is that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>By one man sin entered into the world, and death by Sin; and so death passed upon all men,</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:34554:52"/>which whether you will read it relatively <hi>in quo</hi> in whom, or causally, <hi>eo quod,</hi> because or in as much as all have sinned, I shall be content. These things are plain however.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That death came into the world <hi>by sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That all on whom death passeth, have sin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That many on whom death passeth, (as infants) have not <hi>actual sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Therefore it follows that they have sin derived from <hi>Adam</hi> with their very Natures. That <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal corruption</hi> hath the true Nature of sin; otherwise according to the Apostles arguing, Infants should not be subject to death.</p>
               <p>But here we are told by no mean writer, that <q>Man was <hi>created Mortal,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Yet elsewhere the same hand layes down this assertion contrary to the former,</p>

                  <q>Dissolution of the Soul and Body should have been,

Take this away, and what he saith comes to nothing.</p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:34554:52"/>
               <p>But though <hi>Adam</hi> was not immortal, as <hi>the Saints are</hi> after the resurrection; yet neither was he <hi>Mortal as we all</hi> now are.

                     <hi>Thes. Salm. de Stat. Ada. ante Laps.</hi> Sect. 32. p. 197.</note>
                  <hi>Tam naturalis erat</hi> Adamo <hi>facultas non moriendi, quam non peccandi.</hi> To say, that he was created Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, is to deny that immortality was any part of <hi>Gods Image,</hi> wherein Man was created. Again, death was threatned only in case of disobedience, as we see here, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. Does not that imply, he should not have <hi>dyed,</hi> if he had not <hi>sinned.</hi> As the Apostle telleth us, death entred by sin, and passeth upon none <hi>but Sinners;</hi> Infants dye as well as others, and therefore they are sinners.</p>
               <p>And yet further to evince it, take this Argument; Either Infants that dye in infancy, and are saved, are <hi>saved</hi> by <hi>Christ,</hi> or not; now surely there are none that have the face of Christians, can have a face to say, any in the world are saved <hi>without Christ;</hi> for there is salvation in no other. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hope we may take this for granted, all Infants that are saved, are saved by Christ. And if saved by Christ, then Christ <hi>dyed for them.</hi> If Christ dyed for them, then they were really guilty; truly, <hi>properly sinners</hi> in themselves; otherwise they are none of them saved by Christ.</p>
               <p>Yea, indeed if Infants, or any in the world were innocent and <hi>guiltless</hi> before God; such would have no need of a Saviour, no need of <hi>pardoning</hi> Grace and Mercy; such must go to Heaven another way, not by the <hi>satisfaction</hi> and redemption of Christ. He had dyed in vain so far, had he dyed to purchase <hi>Gods favour</hi> for those, who no way merited his displeasure. Justice it self would not
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:34554:53"/>condemn, but clear all that can plead <hi>not guilty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Methinks, though the Remonstrants would have natural corruption <hi>meerly penal,</hi> not sinful; yet they (of all others) should grant this Argument, who would have the death of Christ intended for all, and <hi>every one alike,</hi> to make the remedy provided in Christ, the second <hi>Adam,</hi> adequate unto our mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and misery, that came by the first <hi>Adam.</hi> Now what need <hi>that Christ's death</hi> should be intended for Infants, to reconcile them to God, if they were not obnoxious in themselves to his wrath?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I have shewed before, the new Law of Grace doth not hinder the old <hi>Original Law</hi> (which requires perfect Obedience and exact conformity to the will of God in all things) from being <hi>still in force;</hi> otherwise we do not sin in not obeying per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, and have no cause to be humbled, and to <hi>sue to God</hi> for pardon and forgiveness upon that account.</p>

                  <hi>Obj.</hi> This corruption of Nature in Infants is not theirs, by an Act of their wills.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Though it be not <hi>a voluntate,</hi> yet it is <hi>in voluntate.</hi> Are sinful habits no sins, because they are not sinful Acts? It comes not by the Child's will, it's true, for it comes <hi>by Nature,</hi> is conveyed naturally. The Child born sinful, because descended from sinful Parents: Yet this corruption is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally and eminently seated in the will, and from the will it acts, and shews it self as soon as the will <hi>can act.</hi> The sin of Infants is not in <hi>Action,</hi> but in this <hi>evil disposition.</hi> We must say this of Children, even <hi>unborn,</hi> or newly come into the world, that they do not actually will the committing of this or that sin, it is from <hi>natural impediments,</hi> the lett
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:34554:54"/>and hinderance is a natural incapacity; otherwise there is that <hi>pravity of will</hi> even Natural to them, which would break forth into all manner of Sin (if God withheld his <hi>restraining</hi> hand) the Natural Impediments of Action being but removed. And is not this enough to make them <hi>Objects of Gods wrath,</hi> and worthy of Death? How can an infinitely holy God but loath, and abhor <hi>such vile Creatures;</hi> whom he seeth (even by Nature) so wickedly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, if he look upon them, as in themselves, and not in and through his Son Jesus Christ? as Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that have evil qualities <hi>by kind,</hi> are the more offensive to us, because those qualities are <hi>Natural</hi> to them. As Wolves for their ravenous disposition, Toads and Serpents for their poysonous quality, before such quality or disposition be put forth into act.</p>
               <p>What I have delivered concerning <hi>Natural cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,</hi> and the sinfulness of it, it is no other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, than is laid down in the 39 Articles, Art. 9. as also in the Articles of Religion agreed upon at <hi>Dublin</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> 1615.

                  <hi>PROP. XXIV.</hi> The Condition of Man by the Fall, being such as hath been described, <hi>viz.</hi> being both <hi>under the Guilt, and power of Sin,</hi> it is twice impossible (as I may say) that ever he should be saved by himself, or by the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> and equally impossible, that he should not be cast, and condemned by this Covenant.</head>
               <p>THe <hi>Covenant of Works</hi> promised life only upon <hi>perfect</hi> conformity to the Law, and will of God, threatning death to any sin: Now when once Man had broken Gods Law, and lost Gods Image, and had his Nature vitiated and corrupted, he could no more lay claim to life and happiness, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately was laid under the <hi>Sentence</hi> of Death, and did lye open to Gods wrath.</p>
               <p>Now if the penalty threatned, and incurred, be inflicted on the Sinner, this giveth him enough,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:34554:55"/>this <hi>sets him fast</hi> for ever. Intollerable torments, and endless miseries become his portion to Eternity. If he would think of making satisfaction for what is past, he cannot. He can never suffer any thing <hi>equivalent</hi> to everlasting death. And if he could, yet he should not be saved by the old Covenant, without some <hi>new Agreement,</hi> wherein it should please God to admit of a satisfaction. Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is not <hi>given to the Law,</hi> (as one noteth) but <hi>to the Law-giver,</hi> as above Law, who can accept of the <hi>solutio tantidem, vel aequivalentis aliàs indebiti.</hi> But there is no provision in the Covenant of Works, how a Man may escape and avoid the penalty, after once he is a sinner. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any more possibility of his claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and <hi>having right,</hi> and title to happiness by the promise in that Covenant; the condition whereof we neither have fulfilled, nor can fulfil. And in these respects (as I said) it is utterly impossible that ever sinful Men and Women should attain to life by this Covenant. Alas, we are all <hi>Children of wrath by Nature</hi> and sons of death, dead in Law, under the Sentence of death. And <hi>dead in trespasses</hi> and sins, in another sence, sin reigneth, as death reigns; all Men Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally are <hi>under the power</hi> of it. Naturally we are without strength, no more than a dead man, <hi>can raise</hi> himself, are we able of our selves to help our selves out of a sinful state, which leadeth to death Eternal.</p>

               <p>I Shall now conclude this Discourse concerning Man's estate under the <hi>Covenant of Works</hi> (both as it was before, and since the Fall) with a few pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Inferences.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What cause is here to admire <hi>divine conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension!</hi> That ever God should vouchsafe to enter into Covenant with his own Creature, whom he might <hi>command at pleasure.</hi> What an honour was it unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> to be called the <hi>Friend of God?</hi> So it was an honour (sure) to <hi>Adam,</hi> to be taken into <hi>a League of Friendship</hi> with God; <hi>Lord what is man that thou shouldst so regard him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. What cause is here to blush at Man's <hi>Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> and most unworthy dealing with his Maker? <hi>Hos.</hi> 6.7. But they like Men, or <hi>like Adam,</hi> have transgressed the Covenant, they have dealt trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherously? Oh <hi>Adam</hi>'s treacherous dealing, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s perfidiousness, <hi>breach of Covenant with God,</hi> is that indeed which all his posterity had need to be told of, have cause with sad hearts to remember and to be ashamed of.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What cause to tremble with astonishment, when we speak, or hear, or think of <hi>Man's Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy</hi> from God, and of the woful, dreadful effects,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:34554:56"/>and consequences of it. The <hi>Crown is fallen</hi> from our heads, <hi>and wo to us, for we have sinned.</hi> Thus Man who was created for the <hi>special Service and fruition</hi> of God, now hath <hi>his back</hi> turned upon God; neither fit to serve, nor to enjoy him. Man that at his first Creation was a <hi>Favourite</hi> of God; since, by his fall and degeneration, is become an <hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> of God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. O what need now that we look to it, that we get our <hi>Tenure changed!</hi> That we get out of the first, into the second <hi>Adam,</hi> without a <hi>change of state,</hi> and a change of Nature, we are miserable for ever. O better we had <hi>never been born,</hi> than not to be born again. As we are <hi>Adam</hi>'s Off-spring, we <hi>inherit</hi> nothing but corruption, can lay claim to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but hell and wrath. And wo to us now, if God deal with us according to the tenure of the Covenant of Works.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you will say, O but we are under the Gospel Covenant, which is unquestionably a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I grant you are so externally; but as to your <hi>Eternal state,</hi> you will be never the better, if you refuse to come up to the terms of this better Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; that is, if you don't in a reall sence of your sinful and undone Condition without Christ, now heartily <hi>give up your selves</hi> to him, to be taught and guided, to be ruled and governed, as well as to be saved by him; or which is all one, if you are not really willing to be saved by the Lord Jesus Christ in his own way.</p>
               <p>I tell you, if you do not come <hi>up to the terms</hi> of the Covenant of Grace, you do in vain expect,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:34554:56"/>you cannot have any saving <hi>benefit</hi> by it; no, in that case it leaveth you to the condemnation of the Covenant of Works; I say, it leaveth you where it found you.</p>
               <p>The wrath of God still abideth on you; yea, this will increase it, that to the breach of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, you <hi>add</hi> this great provoking sin, of slighting and contemning what the Lord is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to offer in the Covenant of Grace. This is <hi>the Condemnation;</hi> verily you will find it so, you that neglect and slight that great Salvation, offered in the Gospel.</p>
               <p n="5">5. O what cause to pitty poor Children, who are so <hi>miserable in themselves</hi> without Gods free mercy in Jesus Christ! Since our first father hath sinned, and brake Covenant with God, his <hi>blood was tainted,</hi> his whole race and off-spring corrupted. This corruption though it came first from <hi>Adam,</hi> yet <hi>immediate Parents</hi> are the next cause of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation of it. How should this <hi>turn our Bowels</hi> towards our poor Children? Are they Children of wrath by Nature, and should they not be our <hi>Beno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni's?</hi> Oh how should our hearts ake for them! and how should we <hi>pour out our prayers,</hi> and tears daily before the Lord for them? O that <hi>Ishmael</hi> might live in thy sight! should not tender Mothers travail in birth again, till they may see Christ formed in their Children.</p>
               <p>And how should Parents fear entailing a <hi>new Curse</hi> upon their posterity! There is a curse in the house of the Swearer, a curse in the house of the Thief, and the unjust person, the fraudulent dealer; many take care for nothing but only to lay up riches for their Children: O but take heed that you do not
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:34554:57"/>lay up a curse with those riches. That would spoil all.</p>
               <p>Again, how should Parents fear corrupting their Children more and more by a bad example; though corruption comes not into the world meerly by <hi>imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> yet evil examples do very much encrease wickedness in the world. <hi>Aetas parentum pejor avis, tulit Nos nequiores,</hi> &amp;c. Hor.</p>
               <p>Lastly, though our Children are by Nature in a sinful miserable estate; yet there is a remedy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in Christ, and set forth in the Gospel; and how should we fear <hi>depriving our Infants</hi> of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance they are capable of, even in infancy! In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants circumcision under the Law pointed at the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Natural birth; so doth Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism under the Gospel. They that deny this Ordinance to Infants, would make Christ less fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the Children of Believers under the Gospel, than he was to the Children of his <hi>people of Old.</hi> Though we do not suppose Grace <hi>necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily tied</hi> to the outward Ordinance, as if whosoever did partake of the one, must necessarily partake of the other; nor think, <hi>as the Papists,</hi> that Original sin hath the Nature of sin, only before, not <hi>after Baptism;</hi> yet surely, we ought to prize any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of Gods <hi>Favour</hi> towards our poor Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and as we would not seem to slight his mercy, we should fear to deny Children this Ordinance, which the Lord alloweth them, which they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of; yea, which is the only Ordinance, and outward means that Infants are <hi>capable of.</hi> And as we should fear to deprive Children of <hi>this Gospel-Ordinance,</hi> so how should we fear to deprive them of the Gospel it self! Rejecting Christ and the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:34554:57"/>Gospel, was that which brought <hi>wrath, to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,</hi> on the <hi>Jews;</hi> should we sin away the Gospel, then we deprive poor posterity of the <hi>means of Grace and Salvation,</hi> and set them in such a state as is described there, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. to have <hi>no hope in the world;</hi> Ah Sirs, the despising of Gospel-Grace, may bring uttermost wrath upon us and ours.</p>

            <head>OF THE COVENANT OF GRACE. Part II.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <q>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>2 Sam. 23.5.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>Although my House be not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ordered in all things and sure, for this is all my Salvation and all my desire, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he make it not to grow.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>I Come now (according to my promise) to give you an account of my Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions,
<note place="margin">Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> concerning <hi>the Covenant of Grace.</hi> An excellent subject, yet attended with difficulties. Some things I confess would discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage me from adventuring on it, and particularly
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:34554:59"/>the <hi>variety</hi> of apprehensions, and the multitude of controversies concerning it. But that the nobleness and necessity of the Doctrine of the Covenant of Grace, together with the great danger of Mens mistaking, and the dreadful <hi>consequence</hi> of many mistakes (too common about it) do on the other hand press and engage me to it.</p>
            <p>Indeed I cannot expect to find you all concurring in the same apprehensions with me; yet sure I am, <hi>in the main</hi> we must agree, and hold together here, or the error will be very gross and dangerous.</p>
            <p>As for any points more disputable (I am not of an imposing spirit) I shall not desire your assent or giving Sentence with me, beyond the <hi>merits of the cause,</hi> and strength of the proof you shall see pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. Touching what hath been delivered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Covenant of Works;</hi> (that first Covenant God made with Man) this is the sum, <hi>viz.</hi> That God having made Man, had a right to rule and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him; and might only have enforced his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands with threatning of severest penalties. Yet to shew forth his infinite Goodness, as well as his Soveraign Greatness, to his Laws he annexed a <hi>free and large promise</hi> of endless life and happiness. Now Man being created a reasonable and innocent creature, could not but <hi>consent to the terms</hi> God propounded. Thus God promised life and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to Man <hi>upon condition</hi> of perfect obedience, and Man engaged to obey God in all things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi> notwithstanding soon transgressed God's Command, violated his Covenant, utterly disabled himself from performing that obedience the first Covenant required, and so deprived himself of all <hi>right and title</hi> to that happiness there promised.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:34554:59"/>Lastly, <hi>Adam,</hi> being the root of Mankind, and having by his sinful fall corrupted his Nature, and begetting Children <hi>like himself,</hi> unclean, fleshly, corrupt, and guilty before God, it became utterly impossible that any of his posterity should attain to happiness by the Covenant of Works. Thus in discoursing of the Covenant of Works I have shewed you.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. What was Man's estate by Creation, <hi>viz.</hi> holy and happy.</item>
               <item>2. What it was by the Fall, <hi>viz.</hi> Sinful and miserable.</item>
               <item>Now 3. I am coming to shew, what it may be by Grace, in and through Jesus Christ.</item>
            </list>
            <p>This is declared and made known in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace.</p>
            <p>Thus the Covenant of Grace is our last and <hi>best refuge.</hi> It is like a plank after a Shipwrack, or like a <hi>fair haven</hi> in a storm.</p>
            <p>Sinners, who are exposed to all wo and wrath by the breach of the Covenant of Works, may find shelter; yet in and under the Covenant of Grace. Sinners, whom a <hi>deluge</hi> of miseries doth threaten to overwhelm, may yet be safe and happy, getting into this <hi>Ark.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Gospel holds forth a pardon to sinners sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced and condemned by the Law. If we look into the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> there we shall only see matter of terrour and ground of despair: but coming to the Covenant of Grace, here we may find opened <hi>a Door of hope.</hi> Hither must we come, here must we rest, as ever we would be happy, of which we should every one say as holy <hi>David</hi> here, <hi>This is all my salvation, and all my desire.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="110" facs="tcp:34554:60"/>
            <p>These are the last words of <hi>David,</hi> Verse 1. <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>David</hi> spake as being divinely inspired. The <hi>last words</hi> of a dying <hi>man</hi> are oft worthy of a speciall remark: how much more are the last words of a dying <hi>Prophet</hi> to be regarded!</p>
            <p>When persons are ready to faint away, then they would call for their strong waters, or make use of the best Cordial they had. Gods gracious promise and Covenant was the choicest Cordial to this holy man of God; he desired no other. Here he had strong consolation, whether his troubles arose from within, or from without; still he could fetch in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and comfort from this Covenant. <hi>Although my house be not so with God] q. d.</hi> Though I and mine are not so as we should be, so exact and even in our walking before God, so <hi>stedfast in his</hi> Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; yet he abideth faithful, though I am too inconstant. He hath made with me an <hi>everlasting</hi> Covenant. Though I cannot but see sad disorders both in my self and others, both at home and abroad, yet his Covenant is <hi>well ordered</hi> in all things. Though I am subject to change, though my outward condition be oft changing, though I be at great <hi>uncertainty</hi> in respect of any worldly prosperity; yet God's Covenant with me that is sure, and there are <hi>sure mercies (Isa.</hi> 55.3.) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it. I can be satisfied with that provision the Lord hath made for me in this his Covenant, however things go with me and mine here in the world. Though my house here should not grow and flourish; yet I can chear up my heart with the thoughts and hopes of those <hi>better things,</hi> God hath promised in his Covenant. O this is all my Salvation, and all my desire. This by way of Preface.</p>
            <pb n="111" facs="tcp:34554:60"/>
            <p>Now in speaking of the Covenant of Grace, the saving Covenant, the everlasting Covenant, the better to open the <hi>nature, tenor, and use</hi> of it, I shall take the same liberty I did before, in setting forth the Covenant of works, <hi>viz.</hi> lay down such <hi>propositions,</hi> as seem to be especially needful, and that as plainly and distinctly as the Lord shall enable me, to clear your apprehensions concerning this weighty and excellent subject.</p>

                  <list>
                     <item>There are but two wayes to be thought of, how Man should come to the enjoyment of God and happiness; that is, either, <hi>1.</hi> By a <hi>perfect conformity</hi> to the will and Law of God, by unsinning Obedience; Or, <hi>2.</hi> Supposing Man once guilty of sin, then in this case by <hi>pardoning Grace</hi> and Mercy.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Or thus,</hi> There are but two wayes to Heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> Either by the Covenant of Works, or by the Covenant of Grace.</item>
                  </list>
               </head>
               <p>NOw since it is utterly impossible to attain to happiness in the way, or upon the terms of the Covenant of Works. <hi>[Do this, and live]</hi> can afford no benefit, hope, or comfort to those who cannot <hi>obey perfectly,</hi> who are already faln short of the glory of God. Since all are concluded <hi>under
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:34554:61"/>sin,</hi> the whole world become guilty before God, whosoever are saved, must be saved in the way, and upon the terms of the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> by Gods free pardoning Grace.</p>
               <p>Certainly, it is a most senseless, irrational con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, as absurd a fiction as ever wild fancy framed, to imagine that any Creature, that is a sinner, and therefore can only lay claim to hell, as <hi>his portion,</hi> (who if he were condemned to everlasting torments, had but his <hi>just deserts.</hi>) that such a Creature should ever properly, and in a strict sence, merit any thing of God for himself, much less satisfie and supererro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate for others. Even <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself being Judge. <hi>Mereri simul aeternam vitam &amp; mortem aeternam repugnantiam includit: Et proinde qui talis esset, deberet vivere in aeternum, &amp; non vivere in aeternum; mori in aeternum &amp; non mori in aeternum,</hi> l. 5. de just. c. 12.</p>
               <p>It implyeth a contradiction; that one should both deserve eternal death, and also deserve everlasting life. And therefore the Papists have no way to <hi>save themselves</hi> here; but by flying to that false distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of sins, that some are mortal, some <hi>venial.</hi> As if there were any such peccadillo's against God, as either deserved pardon, or did not deserve death; what deserves pardon, does not deserve to be punished.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mereri, &amp; non mereri poenam, includit repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantiam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What deserves no punishment, must be counted no fault.</p>
               <p>So likewise Christ needed not to die for those sins, which do not deserve death. Then why does the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle say, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. The blood of Jesus Christ clenseth us from all sin?</p>

                  <hi>PROP. II.</hi> When the Covenant, by which alone is Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is called the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> you are to understand, it is so <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>NOt as if there was <hi>no grace</hi> in the first Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with Man. I have shewed before that it was of Grace, That God (to whom all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble obedience was immediately due from his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; of Grace) that He was pleased to engage and promise to do any thing for Man, for the future; and yet further of Grace, that he promised to do so much. But this new Covenant deserves especially to be called the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> in regard of a more signal Discovery of Gods rich and free Grace in this, than was in the former, that was first made with <hi>Adam;</hi> was it not a <hi>Testimony</hi> of Gods wonderful Grace to provide and appoint Jesus Christ his Son, to be surety and Mediator of this Covenant? so was it not an high expression of his Grace, that God should come to so low terms with Man, in this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; requiring no more than Man<hi>'s sincere and hearty</hi> service and obedience, and promising to accept, and graciously reward the same, <hi>though weak</hi> and imperfect? That the Lord should accept of this, when perfect sinless obedience was <hi>eternally a due debt</hi> from Man, as he was a Creature; was it not of Grace? Again, the benefits <hi>and blessings</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:34554:62"/>held forth and promised in this Covenant, are they not such as do aloud proclaim his Grace? The pardon of sin, a fundamental blessing 'tis impossible it should be otherwise, than of Grace. In that the Lord is a God <hi>that pardoneth</hi> iniquity, transgression, and sin, it proclaimeth and speaks out fully, that he is <hi>gracious,</hi> and merciful, <hi>Exo.</hi> 34.6, 7. And does it not speak out Gods abundant Grace, that in this Covenant there <hi>are greater priviledges</hi> held forth in and by Jesus Christ; than innocent <hi>Adam</hi> could have claimed by the first Covenant, Scil. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of Grace</hi> promised (whereby the faithful do perform and persevere in the performance of what this Covenant requires) and some new <hi>additional degrees</hi> of glory. Happiness was not so sure to innocent <hi>Adam</hi> under the first Covenant, he both might and did fall from it. They that are in Christ have a <hi>firmer title</hi> by the Covenant of Grace, (where perseverance is one thing promised) and have ground to expect some <hi>higher degree</hi> of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. And is not this wonderful Grace indeed, not only to recover Man fallen out of a state of mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but further to raise him to an higher hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.</p>

                  <hi>PROP. III.</hi> The Covenant of Grace is sometimes called, and partakes of the <hi>Nature of a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament.</hi>

               <p>THis Covenant (in both administrations of it, <hi>scil.</hi> under the <hi>Mosaical,</hi> and under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel administration) is called a <hi>Testament.</hi> So <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15, 16.

               <p>Now this seems to be one considerable <hi>difference</hi> betwixt the Covenant of Grace, and that of Works. The Covenant of Grace is called a Testament, as the Covenant of works was not. The Covenant of Grace is the Lord Christ's <hi>last Will and Testament,</hi> concerning his Children and Heirs; what God <hi>requireth</hi> in this Covenant, is in Christ's hand to work in those, who are given him of the Father: and what God hath <hi>promised</hi> here, is also in Christ's
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:34554:63"/>hand to give. Christ is the <hi>Author</hi> and finisher of faith, wherever it is, and the <hi>Donor</hi> of the Crown of life, promised to the faithful, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.28. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.18.

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:34554:63"/>another, then one is a condition to another; and in this respect it is propounded <hi>ad modum foederis,</hi> after the manner of a Covenant. Or take it thus, In respect of God, as he propoundeth it, and men are bound to accept it, as propounded by him; thus it hath the <hi>Nature of a Covenant.</hi> Though, in respect of Christ, as that which God promiseth, and Man engageth to here, was all <hi>purchased by Christ</hi> for the Elect, and by him bequeathed unto all those that come to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the saving benefits and blessings of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, so it is a <hi>Testament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now here I might propound this Question, to be consider'd, whether the <hi>promise of the first subjective discriminating Grace,</hi> or of working of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. belong to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, as a <hi>Covenant,</hi> or as a <hi>Testament.</hi> It seems not to be formally included in the conditional Covenant of grace, nor properly to belong to it as such, but rather as a Testament; but of that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>I confess one of great note, straineth this term too far. Making a <hi>Testament</hi> and a <hi>Covenant</hi> opposites in this respect, that a Covenant hath conditions, but a Testament is an Instrument of meer bounty, <hi>citra ullam conditionem,</hi> without any condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet

B.</hi> so much, provided he Marry <hi>C.</hi> otherwise not.) Again, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. we read, Christ is the Mediator of the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:34554:64"/>New Testament; that by means of Death—they which <hi>[are called]</hi> might receive the promise of eternal inheritance. This Text which speaks ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely of the New Testament, doth not exclude, but include a condition. Who are they that receive the Eternal inheritance, bequeathed in Christ's Will and Testament? They that <hi>are called,</hi> sayes the Text; where doubtless we are to understand effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually called, <hi>so called,</hi> as that they come into Christ upon the Gospel-call.</p>
               <p>And upon this account I should not restrain the consideration of it, as a Testament to the Elect on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, (as Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> before cited, seems to do.) But supposing it a <hi>Will with a Condition,</hi> it is of the same extent with the Covenant; being both one and the same. And so Expositors need not perplex them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves (as some of them seem to do) to reconcile <hi>Moses</hi> (<hi>Exo.</hi> 24.8.) with the Apostle (<hi>Heb.</hi> 9.20.) For thus they are fairly agreed, <hi>Moses enim loquitur de pacto, sed non quovis, nisi dandae haereditatis— Paulus vero de testamento, non quovis, sed conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nato, quod eo ipso est pactum: Ergo sine ulla impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietate à pacto ad testamentum transivit Paulus in hac materia, quia simul utrius{que} rationem habebat.</hi> Tena in Hebr. c. 9. Diffic. 12. Sect. 3. p. 412. b.) <q>
                     <hi>Moses</hi> speaketh of a Covenant, not of any kind, but of giving an inheritance—<hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of a Testament, not of any kind, but conditionate, which in that respect is a Covenant; therefore without any impropriety, <hi>Paul</hi> in this matter passeth from the word <hi>Covenant,</hi> to the word <hi>Testament;</hi> because it had the reason (or form) of both.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:34554:64"/>
               <p>But that the Covenant of Grace is properly a Covenant, and <hi>hath Conditions</hi> (though no such conditions as make it ever the less of Grace.) I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion not to clear and prove her easter, the Lord per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting.</p>
               <p>At present take notice only, that when the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace is called a <hi>Testament,</hi> the reason is not, because it is <hi>absolute,</hi> unconditional; for so it is not; but because it is firm, <hi>unalterable.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed now by the Testator's death. Though it be but a Man's Testament; yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.15. Now the New Testament is <hi>confirmed,</hi> by the Death of Christ the Testator, that there is no adding to it, no disannulling any part of it, Neither as to <hi>matter, nor form;</hi> that this shall be changed any more to the end of the world; no third dispensation to be looked for, whatever some fancy.</p>
               <p>Here then we may all see what <hi>our portion</hi> is like to be. The first <hi>Adam</hi> threw himself out of a very fair estate indeed, <hi>undid</hi> himself and his posterity; our first Father breaking, he left only a <hi>stock of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption</hi> to his Off-spring, that as we descend from <hi>Adam,</hi> we are Children of wrath, and have the curse, due to sinners, entailed on us. That we are ill <hi>provided</hi> for, if not adopted into Christ's family, if not of the Houshold of Faith. There are none <hi>rich towards God,</hi> but they that are heirs of him, who is the heir of all things; what has <hi>Christ done</hi> for thee? Has he remembred thee in his last Will and Testament? Art thou one of those, to whom he bequeathed himself, his body, and blood, and all his saving benefits? say not here, how should I know that? say not, <hi>who shall ascend</hi> into <hi>Heaven</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:34554:65"/>to inform me? the word is nigh thee. Hast thou not a Coppy of of Christ's <hi>Will and Testament</hi> in thy hand? this blessed Book may resolve thee. Art thou one of those that hear his voice? follow him. Art thou led by the spirit of Christ? art thou one of those, that are <hi>given him</hi> of the Father? how shall that be known? thus; if thou hast given up thy self to him. Art thou conformed to Christ? crucified with Christ and the like?</p>

                  <hi>PROP. IV.</hi> The Covenant of Grace is sometimes called a Law, and hath the <hi>force of a Law.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is called the Law of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. It is the Law of life, and the Law of liberty.</p>
               <p>The <hi>will of God</hi> at any time made known to his Creatures is immediately obliging; whatsoever God <hi>revealeth</hi> to us, we are immediately bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; whatever God <hi>requires</hi> of us, we are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately bound to obey. As in the Covenant of Grace there is something that God <hi>requireth,</hi> (and not only what God promiseth,) it must needs have the Nature of a Law.</p>
               <p>Since the old Original Law of works given to Man at first, is broken, and all Mankind laid under a curse, under the <hi>Sentence of Death</hi> by that Law,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:34554:65"/>it hath pleased the Lord (of his infinite mercy and compassion towards poor perishing Creatures) to make and set forth a <hi>new Law,</hi> a remediant Law, a Law of grace, holding forth remission and salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to rebel-sinners, upon their <hi>humble submission,</hi> and hearty return to God; yet withall, threatning death without remedy; yea, and much <hi>sorer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation</hi> to sinners that hear of this Law of grace, and come not in upon it. The Gospel hath the ordinary <hi>Sanction</hi> of a Law, it is backt with a threatning. Yea, it thundreth out the most <hi>dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Anathema,</hi> denounceth the greatest wo to those that have the Gospel published and made known, and yet obey not the Gospel. Ah sirs, this is <hi>the condemnation.</hi> Gospel-condemnation will be found more intollerable than Law-condemnation. The Gospel doth not only promise, but it commandeth, threatneth, and condemneth. That I cannot but wonder any should question, whether the Gospel have the <hi>Nature of a Law.</hi> I would fain know what is essential, and proper to a Law, that doth not agree to the Gospel.</p>
               <p>I say, the Gospel is a Law, [Believe, and thou shalt be saved] is <hi>properly a Law;</hi> as well as [Do this, and live.] Do this, and live, was the old Original Law, first given to Man, and the <hi>matter</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the first Covenant God made with <hi>Adam. [Do this, and live]</hi> i. e. obey perfectly, and so thou shalt live by thy own righteousness. This was the old Original Law. Now [Believe and thou shalt be saved] this is the <hi>new Law of Grace,</hi> which God hath given to Man, as a Remedying Law, (since the violation of the former) and this is the <hi>matter, and summe</hi> of the Covenant of Grace. As
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:34554:66"/>when men accept, and consent to the terms of the Gospel, whether in heart, or in profession, it becomes a formal actual Covenant. Though it binds <hi>as a Law,</hi> at least in order of Nature, before men are bound by it <hi>as a Covenant.</hi> [Believe, and thou shalt be saved.] i. e. come up to <hi>Gospel-terms,</hi> and though thou art a sinner, and deservest to dye, yet thy sins shall be pardoned, and thou shalt live, <hi>for the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi> of another; thou shalt be saved by Jesus Christ, who is a believers righteousness.</p>
               <p>Here I have given you a brief account of the new Law. And that it hath the proper <hi>binding force</hi> and power of a Law, to me seems the easiest thing in the world to make out. Thus, all that <hi>hear of the terms</hi> of the new Covenant, be they heathen, be they strangers to the Covenant, yet are immediately bound to come up <hi>to these terms,</hi> and immediately punishable upon this very account, if they do not come up to these terms. This is plain as can be, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.15, 16. <hi>Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every Creature—and he that believeth not shall be damned.</hi> In this Text it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the Law of faith hath the sanction of a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as well as of a promise. And <hi>wheresoever</hi> the Gospel is preached, all are bound to believe and live according to the Gospel upon <hi>pain of damnation.</hi> So 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.8. The Lord will take vengeance on them <hi>that obey not</hi> the Gospel] that implieth a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding power in the Gospel, sure where there is <hi>no command,</hi> there can be neither obedience, nor disobedience. If the Gospel ought to be obeyed, then it hath the <hi>force of a Law.</hi> If it be a sin, not to obey the Gospel, then the Gospel hath the Nature of a Law; for where <hi>no Law,</hi> there <hi>no transgression.</hi>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:34554:66"/>Again, [taking <hi>vengeance</hi>] on them that obey not the Gospel, implies most strongly, that it hath the force of a Law; would the Lord, the righteous Lord <hi>take vengeance</hi> for no Law broken? would he punish for no crime? Then how should he judge the world in righteousness?</p>
               <p>That is therefore a very <hi>gross mistake</hi> of him, that holds the Gospel <q>a Doctrine teaching,
<note place="margin">A. E.</note> not a Precept binding.</q> Do we not read the plain contrary, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23. This is his <hi>Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ: What? is his Commandment <hi>no binding Precept?</hi> How strange is it, that this should not grate upon, &amp; offend any Christians ears? certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to distinguish here betwixt a <hi>Doctrine teaching,</hi> and a <hi>precept binding,</hi> is as groundless as that Popish distinction of Commands and Counsels, on which they build their monstrously absurd Doctrine of works of Super-errogation.</p>
               <p>But sayes the same writer, <q>No Man is bound to believe <hi>absolutely,</hi> but <hi>conditionally,</hi> viz. if he will have any benefit by Christ. As a man is bound within the time limitted in the pardon, to sue it out under the <hi>Broad Seal;</hi> which if he neglect to do, he breaketh no Law of the Kings, but only deprives himself of the benefit of the pardon, and of the Kings favour therein.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> I will not say, that all are <hi>absolutely</hi> bound to believe in Christ; that is, whether they ever heard of Christ, or no; for the <hi>negative unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi> of those that never heard of Christ, is not their sin, but their misery. But <hi>upon supposition</hi> that men have once heard of Christ, and the Gospel, then it <hi>immediately</hi> becomes their duty to believe.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:34554:67"/>And they are most severely threatned, if they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey the Gospel-commands, and continue in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief.</p>
               <p>But to say we are bound to believe only <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally,</hi> that is, (as he explains it) if we would have any benefit by Christ; is to say, we are not bound to believe <hi>in obedience</hi> to Gods Command: but only out of self-love, with respect to our selves, and the benefit that comes by it. As if he should say, we ought to believe in point <hi>of prudence,</hi> as that which is good for us; otherwise there is no tye upon Conscience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He that believeth not—the wrath of God</hi> abideth <hi>on him,</hi> Joh. 3.36. That is, as he sayes, mincing it, <q>It doth not come upon him, but he <hi>remaineth</hi> under wrath,</q> which faith would have freed him from. Yet <hi>v.</hi> 18. we read, he that believeth is condemned already, <hi>because</hi> he hath not believed in the Name of the only begotten Son of God.] That unbelief is a sin; and <hi>properly a cause</hi> of condemnation; yea, more certainly a cause of condemnation than other sins; other sins are <hi>damnable,</hi> this is <hi>damning.</hi> Though wrath came upon men at first by the breach of the first Covenant; yet a further degree of wrath comes upon men by the breach of the new Covenant, or by sinning against this new Law of Grace.</p>
               <p>Well Sirs, be clear in this; that the Gospel, or new Covenant hath the Nature of a Law, is a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law, <hi>immediately,</hi> and indispensibly obliging all to whom it is made known. By the very Law of Nature, <hi>of our Creation,</hi> we all stand eternally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged both to believe and obey God, <hi>&amp; in revelatis, &amp; in revelandis,</hi> whensoever God reveals his mind and will to any of his Creatures, that this he <hi>requires</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:34554:67"/>of them, and on these terms he will be gracious to them, this revelation of the will of God doth neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily inferr the creatures obligation to observe it. And before a Man can be bound by any act of his own, he is under a previous obligation, naturally and necessarily <hi>resulting</hi> from his very being and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to God, as a creature, to attend to the will and pleasure of God, to act and order himself accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. And how much more that man is bound to accept of, and submit to such a Law as this, intended and provided for the <hi>remedy</hi> and recovery of a poor lost creature: a Law of Grace, wherein Gods free grace and infinite mercy shineth forth so <hi>illustriously,</hi> as it is apter to be taken notice of, than his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty and authority. Yet you must know God doth not stand here <hi>to Man's courtesie,</hi> or need his concurrence or consent, to make his word of force, and obligatory.</p>
               <p>Nothing can be more certain, than that God in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting with men, doth not forgoe or pass away his authority or right of commanding.</p>
               <p>They that under pretence of advancing God's free grace, dethrone his <hi>Soveraignty;</hi> they that level or lessen his authority to set up his clemency and mercy, deal not fairly with him; they have very low thoughts; short, inadequate, and unworthy appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of him.</p>
               <p>For my part I know no stronger Argument against Antinomianism, than this; that it denies that <hi>subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> to God, which is naturally, necessarily Man's duty, as he is a creature, from which he can never possibly be <hi>discharged,</hi> while he is a creature; or that it would deprive God of his authority over his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. They that would have a believer <hi>free from the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:34554:68"/>obligation</hi> to obey God in all things, let them <hi>ask</hi> for him <hi>the Kingdom</hi> also.</p>
               <p>But attend to this I beseech you; what the Gospel requires, God requires; and what <hi>God requires,</hi> his creatures are bound to observe and perform. And though Ministers use <hi>to pray and beseech you</hi> to be reconciled, entreat you to come in to the Lord Jesus Christ; yet we have <hi>authority</hi> also in the name of God, to charge and command you. Now God commandeth every one of you to repent, and this is his Commandment, that ye believe, that ye receive Christ Jesus the Lord, that ye <hi>kiss</hi> the Son. And, slight and despise him at your peril, reject him at your peril. [Believe, and be saved] bindeth every one to whom it is published, <hi>as a Law;</hi> even such as are not under the bond of the Covenant. And you more especially, who have given your consent, at least by an outward profession. You are bound to believe, not only by vertue of a <hi>divine Command,</hi> but also as being under the bond of the covenant. O what a crying sin is your unbelief! As it is a breach of a <hi>divine Law,</hi> it must needs be damnable in its own Nature; and further as it is a breach of such a Law of Grace, a <hi>breach of the new Covenant,</hi> that holds forth the only way wherein you can be saved, so it is <hi>the damning</hi> sin indeed; not only damnable in its own Nature, but certainly damning in the event. Sinners that are condemned by the Law of Works; yet may be discharged from that condemnation by hearkning to, and obeying the Gospel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. But if condemned by the Gospel, how should such escape?</p>

                  <hi>PROP. V.</hi> The Covenant of Grace is betwixt God and Man, not betwixt God and Christ.</head>
               <p>NOte, I am not speaking of that which Divines call the Covenant <hi>of Redemption,</hi> or Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Covenant. Though, whether that can be any thing, but the <hi>eternal deceree</hi> of God, concerning Man's redemption and Salvation by Jesus Christ, in which eternal decree, <hi>the will of the Son</hi> must needs be supposed in the will of the Father, both having <hi>one and the same essence,</hi> and will: (not only a like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and agreement, but an indentity or oneness of will) let the Godly-learned consider. And whether those Scriptures that seem to hold forth a Covenant, or <hi>agreement</hi> betwixt the Father and the Son, are not to be taken as speaking after <hi>the manner of men;</hi> where there could no way possibly be any the least distrust on either side; where there was not the least need of engaging one another for the further <hi>satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of either party, there would seem to be no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion for formal entring into covenant. What ground we have to conceive <hi>a formal Covenanting</hi> betwixt the Father and the Son, where we cannot conceive how the <hi>proper end</hi> of covenanting could have place; Whether the promises in Scripture that run as <hi>made to Christ,</hi> might not be recorded as that voice came
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:34554:69"/>from Heaven, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.30. for his peoples sakes, as one compares them: These are <hi>things</hi> I would leave to them that are able, to weigh and determine.</p>
               <p>Yet I make no question of it, but those that hold a Covenant of Redemption betwixt the Father and the Son <hi>from all eternity,</hi> and others that see not how that can be so well maintained, but think it is a <hi>simple decree,</hi> in which decree the will of all the three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, Father, Son, and Spirit, is included; do how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever both <hi>agree in the thing</hi> aimed at, though their expressions vary. And they that think it is more properly a <hi>decree</hi> from eternity, than a <hi>Covenant from eternity;</hi> yet will say, in this decree the way and manner of our redemption and salvation is as surely, firmly <hi>ordered,</hi> determined, and provided for, as if it had been by way of Covenant, and the most <hi>solemn mutual engagement</hi> of both parties. So both come to one in the end.</p>
               <p>But of this, (whether Covenant or Decree from eternity,)
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Reader, since the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of these notes, I am taught by one, whose judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I cannot but highly value, and reverence, that</hi>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Besides the eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God, there is a</hi> Lex Mediatoria <hi>(a Law of Mediatorship) that Christ is under as man, wherby God made his Mediatory Acts</hi> his dury, <hi>and promised him</hi> his reward, <hi>of which the certain Salvation of the Elect was much. And this Law was also a</hi> Covenant modally.</q>
                     <hi>And of this I suppose those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend and Learned men, that compiled</hi> the larger Catechism. <hi>must be understood to speak, when they say it</hi> [was made with Christ as the second <hi>Adam.] which they call the</hi> Covenant of Grace, <hi>taking in that other Covenant made with man (whereof faith and repentance are conditions) as being founded thereupon.</hi>
                  </note> I am not enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; but when I speak of the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> I mean that which stands in direct opposition, and contra-distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the <hi>Covenant of works.</hi> And though I know
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:34554:69"/>many very reverend, eminently learned, holy and worthy men conceive otherwise, yet many <hi>cogent Arguments</hi> enforce me to conclude this Covenant made betwixt God and Man, not betwixt God and Christ. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Christ is the surety and Mediator of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. and 12.24. And therefore not the party whom God here covenanteth with. For if so, he should be a <hi>surety for himself,</hi> and Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor on behalf of himself. As for <hi>Moses</hi> he was not properly a Mediator, but <hi>improperly,</hi> a type of Christ, the true Mediator. Christ as a Mediator comes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two parties Covenanting. Upon his <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,</hi> upon account of Christ's satisfying, or <hi>undertaking to satisfie</hi> for our breach of the first Covenant made with Man, the Lord was pleased to enter into or make another Covenant with us. This Covenant indeed was <hi>confirmed in Christ.</hi> But I cannot see how it can be said to be confirmed with Christ. It was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, confirmed, ratified of God with respect unto Christ, looking at Christ, as some.</p>
               <p>Some argue that the Covenant was made with Christ, because he is made the <hi>surety</hi> and Mediator of it; but I would argue on the contrary. Because he is the <hi>Mediator</hi> of the Covenant, therefore he is not properly a party wieh whom it is made. What place is left for Man in this Covenant if Christ be both principal, and surety? Or can the same person be both principal and surety in the same Bond?</p>
               <p n="2">2. If this Covenant was made with Christ, then it was made with him, either as God, or as Man, or as God and Man, or Mediator. But it was not
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:34554:70"/>made with Christ, <hi>as God:</hi> For so he makes one party with the Father. Consider him as God, and so the Father cannot <hi>be one party,</hi> and the Son ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but are both of them to be looked on as one and the same party. Nor was this Covenant made with Christ, as Man; none will say that. Christ as Man was under the Covenant of works, not under the Covenant of grace. Was the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>[Believe, and thou shalt be saved]</hi> made to the Man Christ? Or that which is sometimes called the new Covenant <hi>[I will give you a new heart, take away the stony heart, forgive your iniquities]</hi> was the Man Christ taken into this Covenant?</p>
               <p>Nor was the Covenant made with him <hi>as God and Man,</hi> or Mediator; but rather was procured by him, so that in this respect, it is his Testament. <hi>His Testament,</hi> not made to him, but made or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by him. The New Testament in his blood: Indeed if we consider Christ as Mediator, so he is properly no party: if we consider him <hi>as a party</hi> in this Covenant, so he and his Father are one party, and Man the other.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The very terms and tenor of the Covenant of Grace (hinted at even now) do plainly shew with whom it is made. <hi>[Believe, and thou shalt be saved]</hi> which is expressed in other words and phrases under the Old Testament, as <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.3. <hi>Incline your ear, and come to me; hear, and your souls shall live.</hi> Is not this the Covenant that succeeded the Covenant of works <hi>[Do this, and live.]</hi> If the Covenant of Grace be <hi>made with Christ,</hi> then it follows what God requireth in the Covenant of <hi>Grace, is required of Christ.</hi> That he must believe, and must repent, and turn to God.</p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:34554:70"/>
               <p n="4">4. The benefits and blessings promised in the Covenant of Grace, are such as are <hi>proper</hi> to us men, us sinners, and are promised unto Us; not unto Christ. Will any say, that pardon, and <hi>free justification</hi> was ever promised of God to Jesus Christ? were it not blasphemy to say, that Christ had any sin to be <hi>pardoned?</hi> And though he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted, and justified before God, yet not of <hi>free Grace;</hi> but he fully satisfied the highest demands of justice, before he received his discharge.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If the Covenant of Grace be betwixt God and Christ, not betwixt God and Man, then no Man upon earth can be charged with <hi>breach of Covenant</hi> here, or condemned, and punish'd, as a violater of the new Covenant.</p>

               <p n="4">4. If we could understand it no otherwise, than that Eternal life was promised before the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan; yet it will not follow, that this was <hi>promised to Christ</hi> Mediator:

                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. God promiseth to give Jesus Christ <hi>for a Covenant,</hi> Isaiah 42.6. and 49. of <hi>Isaiah</hi> 8. therefore the Covenant of Grace was made with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> It follows not, but rather the contrary; if Christ was promised of God, <hi>as the great blessing</hi> of the Covenant, it implies the Covenant was made, not with Jesus Christ, but with them to whom he was so promised; the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> is a Covenant concerning Christ, a Covenant of him, shewing how, or upon what terms we may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested in him, and made partakers of his <hi>saving benefits.</hi> How then can it be a Covenant of God with him? The promises are <hi>Yea, and Amen, in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.20. not <hi>to him.</hi> Or if when he is promised <hi>for a Covenant,</hi> we understand for a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of the Covenant,</hi> that implyeth still the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:34554:71"/>was not properly made with him, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and those who have him for their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator.</p>

                  <hi>Object.</hi> 4. But fallen Man was unworthy, and unmeet to enter into Covenant with God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I do most freely grant it, I heartily yield this; yet without any prejudice to the Position I have laid down, methinks it is evident, this <hi>sets it off</hi> as a covenant of Grace indeed; that it is a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with fallen Man. O wonderful free Grace! that the Lord should make another <hi>covenant</hi> with Man after Man's violation of that covenant, made with him at first; it was not so wonderful gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious condescension, that God vouchsafed at first to take an <hi>innocent creature</hi> into covenant with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as that after Man hath proved false to God; yet the Lord should please to <hi>treat with him</hi> again, and enter into another covenant with him. That God should make a covenant with fallen men, with <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful creatures.</hi> Methinks no more need to be said, to prove it a Covenant of Grace. And certainly what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever covenant was made <hi>with Christ</hi> (as made with him) was not a covenant <hi>of Grace,</hi> but rather of <hi>Justice;</hi> and whatever we find promised to him, was but a just reward of his obedience and satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. A reward not of Grace, but of Merit.</p>
               <p>But that God should any more covenant with poor sinful creatures, as <hi>David</hi> sayes <hi>[Although my house be not so with God, yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant.]</hi> O this we can never enough admire! And verily I cannot foresee any <hi>inconvenience, or ill consequence</hi> like to attend this assertion, that the covenant of Grace is made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God, and Men; (still supposing Christ to be
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:34554:72"/>the <hi>Mediator</hi> of it) but rather that it doth further <hi>advance,</hi> and set forth the free grace of God, and lay a <hi>stronger obligation</hi> upon Men, than that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion doth, which it opposeth.</p>

               <p>MAny (I know) deny the Covenant of grace to to have <hi>any condition,</hi> yea, make this a main point of difference betwixt the Covenant of works, and the Covenant <hi>of grace,</hi> that (as they hold) the covenant of works was <hi>conditional,</hi> whereas the Covenant of Grace <hi>is absolute.</hi> Yea, they will not stick to say, that if you suppose the Covenant of Grace <hi>conditional,</hi> you turn it into a <hi>Covenant of Works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet many who deny the <hi>Term [condition]</hi> will readily yield <hi>the thing.</hi> Yea, all that have not their judgments wofully corrupted, that have not drunk in <hi>the very dreggs</hi> of <hi>Antinomianism,</hi> must grant the thing, however they take offence without cause at the term, <hi>condition.</hi> Certainly, all that have not suckt in desperate <hi>principle of Errour,</hi> must yield,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:34554:72"/>and assert the necessity of faith, repentance, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere obedience, as <hi>without which</hi> there is no Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which indeed is all we mean, when we say they are <hi>conditions</hi> of the Covenant, and of salvation therein promised.</p>
               <p>Some call them <hi>qualifications</hi> disposing the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as I grant they are: but when we are speaking of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and what it requires, we cannot use any more apt and proper term, than the word <hi>condition.</hi> And what is the condition of a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> but that, <hi>without which</hi> the benefit promised cannot be expected, and upon <hi>which</hi> it may.</p>
               <p>When another promiseth this or that to you, <hi>not simply</hi> and absolutely, but upon Terms, upon such or such a Condition, this you know is a <hi>Conditional</hi> promise. And that upon which the performance of the promise is suspended, is the condition of the promise.</p>
               <p>Now the Lord promiseth life and salvation to us, but <hi>if we believe,</hi> if we unfeignedly repent and turn to him, if we resolve and set upon a course of sincere and <hi>new obedience:</hi> and if we will not come up to these terms, he tells us plainly, there is no salvation for us, but we shall dye in our sins. Now is it not plain, that these are <hi>conditions</hi> of the Covenant, and of the promised salvation, without which men can have <hi>no interest,</hi> right, or ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to what is so promised, Undoubtedly they are Conditions, whether men call them so, or no.</p>
               <p>I am very confident, that many are prejudiced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the term condition, upon a <hi>meer mistake.</hi> As they think, the word either aimeth at the setting up of the power of Nature, or the <hi>merits</hi> of mens
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:34554:73"/>works, or both: when there is no such thing. And I hope sufficiently <hi>to clear</hi> it to you, before I have done with this Subject, that this Covenants condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are neither <hi>meritorious</hi> of salvation, nor to be performed by the power of Nature, or of a mans <hi>own free will.</hi> Certainly, the Covenant of Grace knows, or admits of no such condition, as will not stand with the <hi>honour of free Grace,</hi> But the honour of Gods free grace is not onely secured, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed here, 1. That he would goe so low, that he is pleased to accept of <hi>sincere</hi> obedience, when he might have exacted <hi>perfect</hi> obedience from all his creatures. 2. That he hath <hi>promised,</hi> and doth work the condition in his people. 3. That he hath made so large and <hi>ample promise</hi> to, and doth so glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously reward his own grace, and workings in his people.</p>
               <p>These things premised to prevent <hi>unjust prejudice</hi> I come to the proof of the proposition, that the Covenant of Grace hath some condition, or it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly no covenant. A Covenant is <hi>mutuus contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus per sponsionem &amp; stipulationem;</hi> It is a mutuall engagement of parties, including a promise on the one part, and a stipulation, or condition to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed or required on the other part, on which the promise is suspended, And this is the <hi>difference</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a simple promise, and a Covenant; A <hi>promise</hi> bindeth one party, to wit, him that makes it: a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> bindeth both parties. Thus all Covenants doe necessarily imply, and include a condition.</p>
               <p>It is a very weak and frivolous exception, to say we confound the Covenant of works, and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, if we make this <hi>conditional.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pray observe this, the Covenant of Grace ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:34554:73"/>a condition, it follows that it hath the <hi>Nature of a covenant,</hi> hath that which is proper, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential to a Covenant: but it will by no means follow, that it is of the <hi>same kind</hi> with the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, unless the condition were the same</p>
               <p>I grant indeed sometimes the word <hi>[covenant]</hi> is used for an <hi>absolute promise,</hi> where there is no sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation: but then I say it is used <hi>improperly.</hi> As in <hi>Genesis</hi> 9.9. to <hi>ver.</hi> the 14. That which is there termed a Covenant (probably to shew its <hi>firmness</hi> and <hi>stability,</hi>) yet in strictness of speech is no more than an <hi>absolute promise.</hi> Now if men will compare the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> and the <hi>Covenant of Noah,</hi> not onely in regard of firmness, sureness, but of absoluteness too, as equally, <hi>with condition;</hi> then they must say, that to speak properly, there is but one Covenant made with man, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Covenant of Works;</hi> but as for that, we call the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> it is properly no more, than an absolute promise, properly no Covenant.</p>
               <p>But if the Covenant of Works, and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace are distinct <hi>Species,</hi> they must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily each of them partake of the nature of the <hi>genus,</hi> that is, have what is essential to a Covenant in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as this is essential, even a <hi>promise</hi> with a stipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or <hi>condition;</hi> in this they must both agree, or they cannot both be Covenants, But then the difference of the conditions required in these two Covenants, that is the thing, which makes the distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt these Covenants.</p>
               <p>I hope now you will be able to go along with me here, that to deny the Covenant of Grace hath any condition is to deny <hi>that it is a Covenant.</hi> I hope
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:34554:74"/>Sirs, you will not deny, that there is any Covenant of Grace, to deny conditions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What is a Condition in a Covenant, but that upon which the promise is suspended, which <hi>being put,</hi> we may lay claim to what is promised, and <hi>without which</hi> we cannot claim what is promised. Now is it not the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> that holds forth and promiseth salvation; and it is not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of salvation so suspended upon faith, repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and sincere obedience, that all who have these same now mentioned may certainly expect salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>may lay claim to it,</hi> (not indeed as a thing thus merited by them, but onely merited by Christ for them, and <hi>graciously promised</hi> of God to them.) Such, and none but such (I speak of adult persons) can hope to be saved. And is not that a <hi>condition</hi> of the promise, and of the Salvation promised, which if we have it, then salvation is ours <hi>by promise:</hi> but if we have it not, it is none of ours, we can claim no such thing; One would think that <hi>one Text</hi> alone were sufficient to decide this controversie, as great a controversie as it is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9. <hi>If thou shalt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe with thy heart, thou shalt be saved.</hi> Those with whom we have to doe in this controversie, will grant I hope, <hi>that it is onely the Covenant of Grace</hi> which holds forth salvation, that is, happiness as attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to man fallen. Now we see here, as evident as may be, salvation held forth <hi>conditionally</hi> in this Scripture, <hi>[If thou believest with thy heart, &amp;c.]</hi> therefore the Covenant of Grace holds forth salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conditionally.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I may argue otherwise from this clear truth, which I hope they would be ashamed to deny, <hi>scil.</hi>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:34554:74"/>That we are <hi>saved by Faith.</hi> Now if we are saved by Faith, we are saved by it, either as that <hi>unto which</hi> (though not <hi>for which</hi>) God hath promised salvation, and thus it's apparently made a <hi>condition,</hi> upon which the promise of salvation is suspended: or else we are saved by faith, <hi>without respect</hi> to Gods gracious Covenant and promise, which if so; then faith should save of it self, by some <hi>intrinsick me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> or Vertue of its own; which I hope they that deny conditions in the Covenant, would not dare to assert. So</p>
               <p n="4">4. If faith, repentance, and sincere obedience, be not conditions required in the Covenant of Grace, I would sain know, by what <hi>Law or Covenant</hi> they are required, is it the Covenant of Works; or of Grace, that saith, <hi>whosoever believeth shall be saved?</hi> is it the Covenant of Works, or of Grace, that saith <hi>repent that your sins may be blotted out.</hi> If this be the Tenour of the Law, and Covenant of Works, Then the Law, and Covenant of Works giveth Life: But if this be the Tenor of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, if men will grant that, then it is evident, that the Covenant of Grace is not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, but conditionall.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Suppose the Covenant of Grace <hi>absolute,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out condition, and then how is it possible for any man, or woman in the world to know, they have an interest in the Covenant, and the blessings thereof without extraordinary <hi>divine revelation?</hi> So there could be no such duty, as the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts Christians unto, to <hi>make their calling and Election,</hi> and Salvation sure. If there be no conditions in the Covenant, then all would seem to have an <hi>equall share,</hi> or no <hi>share</hi> at all in it. If it be said, God
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:34554:75"/>did not intend it for the benefit of all <hi>alike</hi> yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, it is impossible that those to whom he doth intend the benefits and blessings of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>should know</hi> any such thing (since they are not expressed by name) if there be no <hi>conditions,</hi> or <hi>qualifications deciphering</hi> the persons to whom those special blessings do belong. Christians, take heed of entertaining this opinion, as you would not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the <hi>true ground</hi> of spiritual peace, and conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. This opinion is very prejudiciall to all sound, solid, <hi>Scripture-hope,</hi> and joy.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We have proved before that the Covenant of Grace, doth partake of the <hi>Nature of a Law;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there must needs be something required. If it were <hi>all promise,</hi> it could not be a Law. We some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times read of Gods commanding the Covenant, <hi>Psal.</hi> 111.9. He hath <hi>commaded</hi> his covenant for ever. Surely he doth not speak this of the Covenant of Works; for that is not the <hi>everlasting covenant,</hi> the Scriptures speak of, As one observes. <q>There is mention made of a <hi>covenant promised, Deut.</hi> 7.12. and there is mention also of a <hi>covenant commanded</hi> (<hi>Deut.</hi> 4.13.) not to imply two Covenants, but <hi>two parts</hi> of the same Covenant, and pray tell me,</q> what is the <hi>Bond of the covenant,</hi> if <hi>it layes</hi> no tie upon man? we read, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.37. of the Bond of the Covenant; And surely (as one sayes) there is a <hi>condition in that Bond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Psal.</hi> 25.10. to keep Gods Covenant, and his Testimonies, are made all one. Covenant and Testimonies are <hi>Synonyma's,</hi> meaning <hi>Legem foede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re sancitam.</hi> The Ark was called the <hi>Ark of the covenant,</hi> because there was kept <hi>the book of the covenant,</hi> Gods Law, which by Covenant they
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:34554:75"/>were bound to observe. <hi>[All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth, unto such as keep his covenant and his Testimonies.</hi> This text cannot speak of the <hi>covenant of Works,</hi> sure. 1. Because there are none, that keep that Covenant. 2. Because <hi>no mercy belongs</hi> to that Covenant. No mercy is to be expected, upon the Terms of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Psal.</hi> 103.18. <hi>To keep his covenant, and to remember his commandments to do them,</hi> are put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the latter as <hi>exegetical</hi> of the former. And <hi>ver.</hi> 17. the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon such as <hi>keep his covenant.</hi> The covenant of works cannot be intended here, The <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks of a covenant of <hi>mercy;</hi> which is yet a covenant requiring <hi>duty.</hi> There are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, as well as promises belonging to the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace. <hi>Commands</hi> to be observed on our part, as well as <hi>Promises</hi> to be performed on Gods part. We must remember and consider, <hi>God is a God,</hi> that enters into covenant with us; and we are his Creatures, we that are taken into covenant. And how can it seem strange that <hi>a God in covenant</hi> requires duty and subjection of his creatures. But this will be further cleared when we come to shew, what the new covenant conditions are.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Seventhly. If the covenant of Grace hath no condition, then none could be said either to keep it or to break it. Then none could be guilty of trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressing, or forsaking it. There is no thinking, that any man should keep the covenant of works. And if the covenant of Grace have no condition; then there is nothing in this covenant for men to keep. If the covenant be absolute, there can be no break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:34554:76"/>of it on mans part. If there are no conditions required, there are none to be observed. If men are <hi>bound to nothing</hi> in this covenant, then though they doe nothing, they cannot be said to fail <hi>in any thing,</hi> to transgress and break this covenant. As yet men are sometimes charged, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.25. <hi>Isa.</hi> 24.5. <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.10.37. pray think a little seriously of this; If you say the Covenant <hi>is absolute,</hi> then it cannot be broken on mans part; then if it be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, it should be broken by <hi>God himself.</hi> But it is horrid blasphemy to charge the <hi>Lord, that is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> with breach of covenant. The objections that are usually made against conditions in the Covenant of Grace, have been answered already in what I premised. To say, that a condition here would <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate,</hi> from the perfection and fullness of Christ's merit, or from the freeness of God's Grace in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing Covenant-blessings, hath no shew of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, unless some <hi>meritorious condition</hi> was pleaded for. Those texts, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. which some urge; I shall speak to, under the ninth propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</p>
               <p>Well. I hope you have seen it cleared, and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably proved, that the Covenant of Grace hath its <hi>Conditions.</hi> Now would you bring this truth home to your hearts, and consciences; Sirs, what can you say for your selves, to evidence your right and Title to the blessings promised? Are you true believers, or not? Are you sound converts, or not? Are you upright walkers, or not? Such you must be, otherwise you cannot escape the condemnation threatned, incurred by the breach of the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> or enjoy the salvation held forth, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised in the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:34554:76"/>
               <p>I may expect, that this Doctrine will not be pleasing to some. They have been called <hi>Legall Preachers,</hi> and <hi>Duty-mongers,</hi> &amp;c. that have held, and maintained the Covenant of Grace to be <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional.</hi> But I have been wont still to suspect those <hi>wayes</hi> and <hi>opinions,</hi> which a carnal corrupt heart na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally complieth with. It is too probable, that such are <hi>false wayes.</hi> How pleasing is it to flesh and blood, to tell sinners of an absolute Covenant, where God hath promised <hi>to doe all,</hi> requiring nothing of them. Christ died to save sinners, &amp; if you are sinners, ther is no more to be <hi>said or done,</hi> but he died to save you; would not such doctrine please the vilest &amp; most graceless wretches. As I remember a <hi>ranting Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian,</hi> that preached such Doctrine as this, about <hi>Cambridge,</hi> That Fornicators, adulterers, effeminate, thieves, covetous, drunkards, &amp;c. are the onely <hi>pieces cut out for</hi> heaven, Though certainly, it was <hi>extreme blockishness,</hi> or something worse than block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishness, not to take notice, that when the Apostle sayes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>[such were some of you]</hi> he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately addes, <hi>but ye are washed, but ye are san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified.</hi> If this were the <hi>message,</hi> Gods ministers had to deliver, were we to tell the drunkard, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean wretch, the covetous, and unjust person, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on <hi>to satisfie</hi> their lusts, that the promise of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and salvation was theirs, as much as any ones; that Christ and heaven did belong to them, as much as to any others; that their <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Title,</hi> is as good as any ones; this could not but be <hi>welcome news</hi> to them. And if this were Gospel light, I wonder how it is possible that Sinners should <hi>hate the light.</hi> Indeed I connot conceive how one that loves his lusts, should not love such preaching. But alas
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:34554:77"/>what is it, but <hi>to sow pillows</hi> under mens arm-holes; This is to strengthen the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising him life. This is to <hi>prophesie peace,</hi> but so as the false prophets were wont to doe. This is a smooth way indeed, but such as leadeth <hi>into</hi> the <hi>broad way.</hi> Take heed of it. This is not building souls towards heaven, but rather to hell, <hi>to lay a foundation</hi> for security and presumption. I would fear to lay principles of despair or presumption either. As I durst not but <hi>encourage</hi> the greatest Sinner amongst you to <hi>leave</hi> your sins; but say, as the Apostle, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Repent, and be converted, that your sins</hi> may <hi>be blotted out:</hi> So I durst not <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage</hi> any of you <hi>to live in sin,</hi> as if ye might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in sin, and yet hope that Gods <hi>abounding Grace</hi> would extend it self to you in the pardon of your sins. No, if ye live after the flesh ye <hi>shall dye: but if through the Spirit, ye mortifie the deeds of the body ye shall live, Rom.</hi> 8.13.</p>

                     <hi>Mr. Patient, Dist. of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants.</hi> p. 30, 31.</note>
                  <q>It is a Covenant without all condition required in the creature, but what God himself performeth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now though I freely grant no man <hi>would perform</hi> the condition of the Covenant of Grace, without special grace and help from God; yet to say, It is without <hi>all condition,</hi> but what God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self performeth, is a rash, unsound assertion. For,</p>
               <p>First, It is self-<hi>contradiction.</hi> It is to say the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is absolute, and not absolute; without all condition, and not without all condition required in the creature.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is indeed <hi>blasphemous</hi> to say that God doth believe in us, repent in us, obey in us. He giveth the grace &amp; <hi>ability,</hi> but it is man that <hi>performeth</hi> the <hi>Act.</hi> He giveth his people that <hi>special help,</hi> whereby they come to believe, repent, obey. But it is one thing for God to enable us to perform the condition, and another to perform it himself. It is below the <hi>Majesty of God</hi> to perform the condition for us; as it is <hi>above us,</hi> quite above our strength, to perform it without him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If there be no condition required in the creature, but what God <hi>performeth,</hi> then the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant should run thus, I the Lord do promise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission and salvation unto you, <hi>upon this condition</hi> that I give you an heart to believe and repent, upon condition that I <hi>perform</hi> this in, and for you. Thus God should require the condition of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self not of us. Which is <hi>most absurd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Thus men should not deserve to suffer for <hi>non-performance</hi> of the condition; it being that
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:34554:78"/>which God is to perform, and otherwise not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in, or of the creature. If the Covenant lieth <hi>wholly on Gods part,</hi> then how are men punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for not keeping Covenant? This is evident, that such as have the Gospel preached to them, and do not come up <hi>to the Terms</hi> of the new Covenant, (do not believe, and repent,) they not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive themselves of the life and happiness there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, but also incurre <hi>the penalty threatned.</hi> Now will God punish any for unbelief, when faith was not required of them; or not required, till the Lord performed it in them? If that position I am disproving, <hi>were true,</hi> the Gospel should never threaten condemnation for unbelief. Where God <hi>performeth</hi> this for any, that they believe, they are freed from condemnation upon that account; and as for others, who have not this performed in them, it is not required of them, God requiring no more than he <hi>performeth.</hi> By this time I hope you are sensible, that it a dangerous assertion, to say, <hi>God requireth nothing in the Covenant of Grace, but</hi> what <hi>he performeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And so it is as false to say, that the condition of this Covenant is <hi>performed by Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>It is <hi>enough</hi> for us (says one) to believe that Christ hath repented for us,
<note place="margin">Saltmarsh.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved for us.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But it is not required of Christ, but of <hi>us sinners,</hi> to repent, and believe. Jesus Christ was made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, and kept it to a tittle, fulfilled all righteousness, he <hi>performed the condition</hi> of the first Covenant. The Covenant of Works, which <hi>Adam</hi> brake, Christ fulfil'd. But he was not <hi>under the Gospel,</hi> nor was he concerned to perform the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:34554:78"/>of the Covenant of Grace, but onely to see that his people the heirs of salvation do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it.</p>
               <p>To advise souls that doubt of their <hi>Gospel sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> to see <hi>it in Christ</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> does) to see it in Christ, who hath obeyed perfectly, is miserably to confound the conditions of the <hi>two Covenants,</hi> which ought to be most carefully distinguished. And it implieth thus much, as if such were troubled about what doth not at all <hi>concern</hi> them. Why should any trouble themselves about the condition of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, to find it in themselves, if Christ hath <hi>performed</hi> the same for them? As if souls should disquiet themselves, that they cannot see how they can satisfie <hi>Gods justice</hi> for their sins, when Christ hath done that, and it is not expected from them. If Christ hath performed the condition of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace for us, then it belongeth not to us to perform it. It is done already <hi>to our hand.</hi> And we should not presume to take Christs work out of his hand.</p>
               <p>And if Christ fulfilled the conditions of <hi>both Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants</hi> for us, then it followeth, that even as he made us without us, so he <hi>saveth us without us;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12. So likewise it followeth, that all for whom Christ hath satisfied (whether they were all mankind, or all the Elect) are <hi>immediately justified,</hi> actually discharged from all sin, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, immediately <hi>interested</hi> in the benefits and blessings of the Covenant of Grace, in a state of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as soon as ever they are in <hi>being;</hi> there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing required to their interest in the same, but what Christ hath done for them. So it follows, that such were never <hi>children of wrath,</hi> but alwaies
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:34554:79"/>in a state of reconciliation with God, contrary to <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. And so again, that we are not justified <hi>by faith:</hi> but <hi>before faith,</hi> and without it, contrary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. And then, what should hinder, but that men may be justified and saved, who never do believe, contrary to <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that believeth not shall be damned.</hi> But that the condition of the covenant of Grace is not <hi>performed by Christ,</hi> but by us, appears from that Proposition cleared and proved before, That the Covenant of Grace is not <hi>betwixt God and Christ,</hi> but betwixt God and us, or betwixt Christ and us.</p>

                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:34554:80"/>For all that are drawn of the Father (in the sense of this Text) they <hi>come to Christ,</hi> (see <hi>ver.</hi> 45.) but all that have morall suasion do not come. Those carnal <hi>Jews,</hi> Christ was preaching unto there, had <hi>moral suasion;</hi> yet did not come, not being drawn of the Father. And is it not as plain, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers drawing <hi>determineth</hi> mans will, is not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by it? Otherwise he should not so proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be said to <hi>draw</hi> men, as to <hi>be drawn:</hi> he should not lead, but follow.</p>
               <p>It is <hi>giving a new heart, Ezek.</hi> 36.26. Does God give a <hi>new heart</hi> to all? Surely no. Therefore this intended something more, than any <hi>common help</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded to all. All have not a new heart given them, If no more were included in it, than <hi>moral suasion,</hi> then Ministers might be said to give men a new heart, when they perswade them to get their hearts renewed. But that an inward <hi>efficacious, heart-changing work</hi> is intended in that expression, may appear from <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.2. Yet the Lord hath not given <hi>you an heart to perceive</hi>] when as he had given them (besides their natural faculties) his word, miracles, abundance of means, fitted to work on them <hi>objectively,</hi> morally. And certainly Gods putting his Law in our inward parts, and writing it in our hearts, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. is more than <hi>bare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing</hi> it, more than offering it to our understanding</p>
               <p>Besides the illumination of the understanding, it must needs include a <hi>renewing</hi> of the will. And there is no obeying God aright, till he give us this heart to obey. NO believing in Christ, till the Lord give us an <hi>heart to believe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus Faith is the gift of God. Ministers may preach the necessity of faith, may perswade to it, but cannot give it.</p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:34554:80"/>
               <p>It is Gods taking away the heart of stone, and giving an heart of flesh, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. The stony heart of man would never yield of it self, or relent of it self.</p>
               <p>It is called <hi>regeneration, Joh.</hi> 3.3. A being born again, born from above, born of God. And no believing till we are <hi>born of God, Joh.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13. We must be spiritually alive otherwise we cannot <hi>act spiritually.</hi> No believing without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, therefore no believing without special grace. Will any say, that regeneration is no more than moral suasion? or that it is common to all? Is this their <hi>gratia sufficiens,</hi> which they would have given to all? Then if all have regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, if all are <hi>born of God,</hi> it follows, all are the children of God, and all are believers; for so are all that are born of God. Methinks this is plain, All <hi>are not born of God;</hi> but it is of his special grace that any are thus born again. Yet no believing without being born of God: and so no believing without special grace.</p>

               <p>I cannot understand how they can heartily pray for grace for themselves or others, that assert the <hi>liberty of mans will,</hi> in opposition to the special de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining grace of God. How shall they pray to the Lord to <hi>turn</hi> them, (as <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18.) to change their hearts, to order their steps in his word, to <hi>encline their hearts</hi> to keep his Laws, who hold that all God does is to set mans will <hi>in aequilibrio,</hi> in an equal poize, not that he ever determineth mans will so by his grace, but leaveth it free to determine it self?</p>
               <p>And if we must hold, that God giveth to all men that are alike in their carriage, like grace, <hi>in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;</hi> not to one more, to another less; then how can I pray or hope, that he should do that for me, which he will not do for every one in the world, of the like condition and capacity with me? Yea, why should <hi>men pray</hi> at all? If this be the inflexible rule of his dealings with the children of men, there would seem to be no more <hi>ground for prayer</hi> here, than that we should pray that the ordinances of heaven, and Gods Covenant with day and night might conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to the end of the world, that sun and moon might still keep their course, or on the other hand pray for an alteration of the most settled course of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Thus all our <hi>prayers for grace</hi> should signifie no more, than such a declaration as this, <q>Lord, thou hast given man freedom of will to choose, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse

Thus indeed the <hi>will of man</hi> is made the direct, true, and proper cause of his first conversion and coming unto Christ; and the <hi>divine grace</hi> and help no more than barely an antecedent, or a faint <hi>causa sine quâ non.</hi> That which being put, yet it was altogether uncertain, whether the <hi>happy effect</hi> would follow; which had been in vain, and utterly lost, but that the <hi>free will</hi> of such thought good to determine the matter on its side. Thus a man should owe the <hi>praise</hi> of his own conversion, not so much to Gods Grace as to his own free will; his willing to accept of, and improve that fame <hi>exciting grace,</hi> which others had in common with him, and rejected, or resisted.

               <p>Now I come to answer some objections against special grace; and its efficiency in the work of a sinners conversion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Does not this overthrow the nature of mans will? The will is free, and cannot be forced.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The will is not <hi>compelled,</hi> but enclined, and determined by grace.</p>
               <p>Mans will (considered in his lapsed estate) is not <hi>morally free,</hi> not free from a vicious sinfull inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. All that do not denye original sin, must grant this. Now hence it follows that without a <hi>special work</hi> of Grace, turning and changing the natural bent and inclination of the will, a man cannot break off his sins, give up himself to obey God, to be ruled and governed by Jesus Christ. That a man left to himself would do nothing but sin, would never leave
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:34554:84"/>the trade of sinning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Every imagination of the thoughts of his heart</hi> being <hi>onely evil continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Jer.</hi> 13.23. <hi>Can the Ethiopian change his skin, &amp;c.</hi> Now it is the work of divine grace to enlighten the mind, and renew the will, to heal it of that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt inclination, to take off that strong <hi>propension</hi> of the soul to sin, and its prejudice, perverseness, and obstinacy against God and Jesus Christ. And as this is taken off, the soul is <hi>coming</hi> on towards God, <hi>of unwilling is made willing</hi> to believe, repent, obey. And the more that the former sinfull <hi>inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and perverse disposition is taken off, the more willing and free is the soul unto these gracious Acts.</p>
               <p>Now if you can but distinguish betwixt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural power, or faculty of the will, and the <hi>moral vicious habits</hi> and inclinations of the will, you will see clearly that Grace doth not overthrow the nature of the <hi>will</hi> or of its <hi>Acts:</hi> but onely is contrary to that evil inclination brought in by the fall. They that suppose Gods Grace goeth thus far with all, as to set their wills in an <hi>equal inclination,</hi> to good as to evil, they will not deny (sure) but that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this grace, mans will was only enclined and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined unto evil. Now if when mans will was wholly, and <hi>onely enclined</hi> unto evil, the Grace of God could work thus far on it, as to bring it to an <hi>aequilibrium,</hi> to an indifferency or hovering betwixt two (whereas it was only one way bent before) I say, if Grace could thus far <hi>turn the bent</hi> of the will without overthrowing the nature of the will, and intrenching on <hi>its Liberty,</hi> let any man give us a reason, why the grace of God may not goe <hi>one step</hi> further with the will, so as to encline and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:34554:85"/>it to good, (that the prevailing bent of the will should be that way) still without infringing its Liberty.</p>
               <p>I cannot see any danger, or inconvenience in grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing [that men have a natural <hi>power</hi> to believe and obey] rightly explained. That when God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth us to believe, repent, &amp;c. he doth not command what is <hi>naturally impossible,</hi> what we have no more power to do, than to cause the sun and moon to stand still, or to remove <hi>mountains</hi> with a word. No, God hath given man those faculties, or powers of understanding and will, which are apt to obey, and receive his Commands, if they were not hindered by an <hi>evil disposition,</hi> and inclination, at first contracted by the fall, and further increased, strengthened and rooted, by the abuse of them in the practice of sin, but though men have the natural powers, or faculties, for want of a <hi>right constitution</hi> of them, they would never produce any gracious Acts of themselves. A meer <hi>natural power</hi> is not enough here, where there is no moral power, no true disposition and inclination to that which is truly spiritually good. And there is no such disposition or inclination without Grace. Now as men have a <hi>Natural power</hi> to believe and obey, but no true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination thereunto without Grace, so we may say on the other hand, men have <hi>a natural power to reject Christ</hi> and his commands, where special grace is vouchsafed

                  </q> Which must be taken with restriction, in reference to the <hi>same act.</hi> For a Law may oblige to punishment for past disobedience, and yet oblige to obedience for future, too; yet sayes he, <q>when therefore man lay under the curse, he was no <hi>further obliged</hi> to obedience;
<note place="margin">ibid.</note> because God would no longer be served by him. For that God will be served of his creature, it is of favour.</q> But as Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> sayes. <q>It is altogether <hi>undecent,</hi> especially to the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and righteousness of God,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ball of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, p.</hi> 289.</note> that that which <hi>provokes</hi> the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, should procure the abrogation of his Laws. That that should <hi>supplant</hi> and undermine the Law, for the alone preventing whereof, the Law was before <hi>established.</hi>
                  </q> The truth is, it cannot but be the <hi>creatures duty</hi> to serve God, and obey him in all that he is pleased to command. It is but right and just that God should require this of all, even of sinful creatures. The creatures <hi>guilt</hi> is no fair plea against <hi>Gods right.</hi> It is against all reason that mans disobedience should discharge him from a <hi>tye to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> that his transgressing Gods commands should void Gods right of commanding.

                  <hi>si sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lato praemio &amp; introducto reatu poenae cessaret obligatio,</hi> then it would seem that man from the beginning could be bound by no
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:34554:87"/>Law, but what he voluntarily would accept of. For if by a mans choosing to undergo the guilt and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishment, rather than to perform obedience, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation be disolved, it would seem the Obligation was rather arbitrarily taken on him, as in <hi>a free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract</hi> betwixt a servant and his master: not that he was naturally, necessarily bound to obey God, from his very being; as he was his Creature. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides it would follow (as the forementioned Author also notes) that there should be no actual sin, but onely the first sin of <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, To come closer to the objection, I would not say <hi>simply,</hi> that a man hath no power to believe, but <hi>no will</hi> to believe, without special grace, <hi>posse cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere naturae est hominum; velle credere gratiae est fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi> Or thus, we must distinguish <hi>of power</hi> (as was hinted in the Answer to the former objection) power is either Physical, <hi>i. e.</hi> Natural; or <hi>Ethical,</hi> moral. That in <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44. No man <hi>can come to me,</hi> may be well explained by that, <hi>John</hi> 5.40. <hi>ye will not come to me,</hi> ye cannot come, because ye will not: ye <hi>will not come,</hi> without <hi>special grace</hi> draw and <hi>encline</hi> you to it: But if mens wills were to it, they should not be kept off for want of <hi>power.</hi> Did ever any thing hinder any soul's coming unto Christ that was truly willing to come.</p>
               <p>But (you will say) sinners cannot will to come to Christ, but I would ask you again, why can they <hi>not will</hi> to come to him? If they have Christ held forth, and hear the Gospel inviting sinners to him; what is it but a wicked perverse disposition, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of will, that keepeth them from him, as
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:34554:88"/>Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> sayes well <q>He that refuseth to come,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, p.</hi> 244.</note> refuseth not <hi>through inabil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> as unable, though willing and desirous to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it, but <hi>willingly preferring</hi> some base inferior good before it. And again, That man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>p.</hi> 245.</note> this he oweth unto God, and that not simply alone, but comparatively in respect of others who believe not: but that man <hi>refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth</hi> the promises of mercy, this is of himself, not of simple or <hi>Natural infirmity</hi> which might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure pity, but of his own perverseness and love to some inferior good, &amp;c. (you may see more in him to this purpose, p. 343.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 3. Do you not make God as one <hi>that mocketh,</hi> in the tenders of his grace, offering mercy to sinners on such terms, and conditions, as they cannot attain to without special grace which is vouchsafed but to a few of many.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> No. God do's not mock sinners but is as <hi>serious</hi> as may be, telling them <hi>on what terms</hi> he will be gracious to them. That if they will come in, they shall find mercy; otherwise not.</p>
               <p>Thus the Covenant of Grace holdeth forth a <hi>possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> of Salvation to sinners, condemned by the Law and Covenant of works, and is there no grace in this? Again, here the Lord <hi>requires less,</hi> than in strict justice he might require, less than the law of works, (which all men naturally are under) doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act. And is there no grace in that?</p>
               <p>And what he requires, <hi>he hath absolutely</hi> promised to work in some. And is wont to work in his people <hi>by the calls,</hi> invitations, promises, &amp;c. of his word and Gospel. His grace and spirit concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and is there no grace herein.</p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:34554:88"/>
               <p>But let God be true, and every man a liar. Is He not <hi>beforehand with</hi> sinners? Did he mock the world, when he gave his Son to be the Saviour of all, and every one that would believe in him? Does he <hi>mock men,</hi> in calling, and perswading them to Christ in the Gospel? should any one of them be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, <hi>if they came?</hi> yea, does he not ordinarily concurre with the word and outward means, in some sort <hi>to prepare</hi> men for converting grace? And can it be proved, that ever he deserted any one in the way to conversion, till provoked by their neglect of him, and rejecting of his grace offered? As one of the Antients, <hi>Qui &amp; priusquam deseratur, neminem deserit, &amp; multos desertores sepe convertit.</hi> Does he not complain of sinners, <hi>Because when he called they refused, Prov.</hi> 1.24. Now what an unjust, and unworthy thing is it, for any to charge God, as if he dealt not cordially with us in the offers of his grace, when he denies <hi>special</hi> grace to none, but such as have first neglected to improve <hi>common grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And certainly, men may as soon perswade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers <hi>out of their senses,</hi> to conceit the Sun is a dark spot, that snow is black, and fire cold, and honey bitter, As that God in the Covenant of Grace doth meerly pretend and make show of grace and mercy to sinners: but that in very deed he only <hi>mocks</hi> them.</p>
               <p>O that sinners would try, whether God is not <hi>seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Let the wicked for sake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God for he will abundantly pardon, Isa.</hi> 55.7. <hi>As I live saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live, Ezek.</hi> 33.11. O sinners will you trie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:34554:89"/>the Lord be not serious, O that you could be <hi>perswaded to try!</hi> you would never repent of this repentance, Turn to the Lord and you would then resolve, (by the help of his grace) never to turn away from him more.</p>
               <p>If now you will say, Alas, we <hi>cannot turn.</hi> I must tell you from God, then you cannot live. And it is as if a <hi>malefactor</hi> taken and reprehended should say, I cannot leave this course of mine, I cannot <hi>leave</hi> my trade of thieving, robbing. A moral <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, that</hi> is indeed a <hi>will-not.</hi> It is very true, that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>velle,</hi> the moral power is not vouchsafed to all. God doth not work in every one <hi>[to will]</hi> yet he vouchsafeth means for the removall of impotency natural; So they that have Gospel-calls, have <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>posse si velint.</hi> They might come if they would. All the hindrance is in themselves, in their perverse wills. As Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> (p. 343.) <q>The invitation is not so hard, that a man cannot fulfill it, if he would: but such as if man would, he could not but exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute.</q> Now will you say God is not serious, when he calleth you? But one day it will appear, that you only were guilty in this respect, that you would not be perswaded <hi>seriously</hi> to attend to Gods most serious offers, indeed sinners will not be <hi>seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> but tempt Christ, mock God most shamefully; and yet think to excuse themselves by charging God <hi>foolishly,</hi> as if he mocked them, and dealt not truly and sincerely with them.</p>
               <p>But seeing the reason why men do not turn to God, is not that the thing required is <hi>unreasonable,</hi> (what can be more reasonable, than that a sinner who deservs to be for ever <hi>damned</hi> should judge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn himself, acknowledge and turn from his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:34554:89"/>and most <hi>heartily and gladly</hi> lay hold on, and embrace Mercy and a Pardon offered, prising it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove any thing in the World.) Since it is thus, God does not require any unreasonable thing of men, but the true direct and proper cause of their standing off, is the <hi>unreasonable</hi> wickedness and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versness of their own wills: It is evident that men are in <hi>all the fault,</hi> that they do not turn to God, and that their Destruction is of themselves.</p>
               <p>And though God takes hold of some by his Grace, and Spirit (as the Angel <hi>took hold</hi> of <hi>Lot,</hi> who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise had perished in <hi>Sodom</hi>) thus the Lord by his special Grace <hi>prevents</hi> some (whom he hath Elected unto Life) that they should not run upon <hi>Eternal Ruine,</hi> with the generality of the World; yet this is a <hi>most free Dispensation</hi> of his rich Grace. And had the Lord done no more for these <hi>chosen Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,</hi> than for the basest Potsheards of the Earth, yet they could not justly have blamed him, as any way behind-hand with them: Had he left all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to perish in their Sins, God had been <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> and the whole World without Excuse.</p>
               <p>One thing more, They Argue thus, what is it, but to <hi>Mock men,</hi> for the Lord to Invite and Call on them to come, who (he knows) will not come without <hi>Special Grace,</hi> which yet he gives not to the far greater part of men Invited. They might as well Argue thus against <hi>Divine</hi> Presci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:

                     <hi>Vid. Cameron. Defens.</hi> c. 15. p. 227, 228, 229, 230.</note> here to Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish between a <hi>Benefactor</hi> and a <hi>Judge,</hi> or Rector. Consider God as Rector, and Judge, and so he is no respecter <hi>of persons,</hi> he gives one Law to all, lays down the same Rule for all; he commandeth all men every where to Repent. And according to the same Law he Judgeth, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17.

               <p>But then secondly, Consider God in those special Acts of Grace and Bounty wherein he is not to be looked on as <hi>Judge,</hi> but as a Free-Doner, or Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor only: And who can say, that here he may not <hi>respect some,</hi> more than others?

               <p>Secondly, Though we cannot define it, yet that it is a supernatural working, but <hi>congruous</hi> and sute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the nature and faculties of the rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we are not to doubt. It is a <hi>sweet drawing,</hi> or a powerful and most surely, and prevalent perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the soul to Christ. It is divine teaching, that is, teaching to purpose, Gods giving an <hi>heart to perceive;</hi> every one thus taught of God, cannot but learn, That divine light which strikes the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and <hi>breaks in</hi> upon the soul in the work of conversion, it necessarily, infallibly, irresistably, produceth a new apprehension of things, whereas the soul was blind before, now it sees clearly: It was in a state of darkness before, but is now light in the Lord. This illumination of the mind is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-work of the souls renovation and sanctification. <hi>Powerfull</hi> and thorow conviction the beginning of conversion. All sides are agreed that the Lord can and does oft shine in upon the understanding with that clear <hi>manifestation</hi> of the truth, and of the chiefest good, and of the onely and necessary means condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to the enjoyment of it, that the understanding is <hi>necessarily</hi> captivated by it, cannot but give its
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:34554:91"/>full Assent. That to believe the contrary were to believe a lye and falsity under the <hi>Notion of a lye, and falsity,</hi> which is impossible.</p>
               <p>Now this may give us to understand the way and method of Gods grace so far as it is necessary for us to know it, <hi>scil.</hi> that he drawes with the <hi>bands of a man,</hi> deales with man as a reasonable creature, worketh upon the will by the understanding first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned.

And we must needs think, there is a great difference betwixt the discovery of truth by the meer <hi>light of natural</hi> Reason; and the eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of it by the demonstration of the Spirit, as there is a difference of seeing things by the dim light <hi>of a candle</hi> and of seeing them in the clear light of the Sun: Though there is a common illumination of the Spirit, yet there is also a <hi>special illumination.</hi> It is true the common illumination leaves men but almost perswaded to be Christians; but the <hi>special illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> causeth thorow sound conversion. As the mind and understanding is never thus spiritually enlightned, but the heart is touched, the will rectified. As the soul at first was corrupted by the understanding, so by the way of the understanding it is renewed.</p>
               <p>Thus I hope you have seen this last Proposition of the necessity of <hi>special grace</hi> cleared. I cannot pass
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:34554:92"/>from this point, without hinting what special use is to be made of it.</p>
               <p>First, It should make Christians very <hi>humble</hi> and very <hi>thankful.</hi> O sirs, it would become the best of you all to have <hi>very low</hi> thoughts of your selves, but <hi>exceeding high thoughts</hi> of God, and his free, and powerfull distinguishing grace.</p>
               <p>For my own part: I can say, ever since I came to understand any thing to <hi>purpose</hi> in Religion, and Christiany, I could not but have a suspition, that those opinions were <hi>not right,</hi> that tend to set up the power of man, and lessen the grace of God in the work of his conversion, and Salvation. And when I first met with that of <hi>Grevincho's,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Quis se discernit? in promptu causa est. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go me ipsum discerno.</note>
                  <hi>I make my self to differ,</hi> I could not entertain it but with abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, As still it seems to me a very impudent, arrogant and <hi>graceless speech.</hi> What he adds does not at all qualifie it, I think.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quum enim Deo, ad prae determinationi divinae resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ere possem, non restiti tamen, at qui in enim quid in lice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at mihi tanquam de meo gloriam? Quod enim potui Dei quidem miserentis est, quod autem volui, quum possem nolle, id meae potestatis est.</hi> He should have said <hi>meae virtuis. q. d.</hi> That I have a power to be good, this is of God: but that I am better than another this is of my self</p>
               <p>He would onely acknowledge, that God gave him the power, but that he had a will to use it aright, this he had of himself and might glory of it, as <hi>his own.</hi> Such men may seem to give the first fruits to God: but clearly rob him of his Tenths. The first fruits under the Law might be one of sixty. The Tithes must be one of Ten. They devide unhandsomly,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:34554:92"/>and take the <hi>greater share</hi> to themselves, and what is most Praise-worthy, giving God the <hi>Lesser share;</hi> whereas indeed the whole work of Conversion is his, the will of man never inclining to God, till inclined by his Grace.</p>
               <p>O Christians! be very sensible of the strength of Natural Corruption, and of the Freeness, and <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> of Gods renewing Grace. Indeed a right sense of the one would help you to a clear <hi>discerning</hi> of the other, and a due Apprehension of both would tend to make you more <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>thankful.</hi> As the state of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> is described, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such is thy Estate by Nature, so Poor, Miserable, and <hi>Helpless</hi> wert thou, O Christian, thy Birth and thy Nativity as that of the cursed <hi>Canaanites, thy Father as an Amorite, thy Mother as an Hittite,</hi> and thou <hi>all polluted in thy own Blood:</hi> Yet when it was thus, the Lord passed by thee, and looked with Compassion on thee, and said to thee, <hi>When thou wast in thy blood, Live;</hi> yea, he said unto thee, <hi>When thou wast in thy blood, Live:</hi> He passed by thee and behold thy <hi>Time</hi> was the <hi>time of Love,</hi> and he spread his Skirt over thee, and covered thy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness: Yea, he sware unto thee, and entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Covenant with thee, and thou becamest his.</p>
               <p>Art thou Implanted into Christ? When thou wast a wild Olive-Tree, did'st thou Ingraft thy self into the good <hi>Olive-Tree?</hi> Certainly, this is every whit as strange, as for an evil Tree to bring forth <hi>good Fruit.</hi> Boast not, Christian, thou bearest not the Root, but the Root thee.</p>
               <p>Art thou a Child of God?

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:34554:93"/>was his Spirit and Power that <hi>Regenerated</hi> and his <hi>Grace</hi> that Adopted thee. How hadst thou thy New Birth; certainly not of the <hi>will of the flesh, nor of the will of man,</hi> but thou wast <hi>Born of God,</hi> John 1.13. <hi>Born of the Spirit,</hi> John 3.5. Art thou a <hi>new Creature?</hi> Who made thee so? Surely thou wilt not say, or think, that thou art thine <hi>own Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi> If a man of his own will, without the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace of God did Convert and <hi>change himself,</hi> then should he be his own Creature. But the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle hath taught us otherwise, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.10. <hi>We are Gods Workmanship, Created in Christ Jesus.</hi> To make a new Creature is the Work of God, not of any meer Creature. And to think what a change <hi>Divine Grace</hi> hath made in you that are Renewed, what a difference from your selves, from what you were before, and what a difference from others; it should not <hi>puff you up</hi> with any high Thoughts of your selves, but lift you <hi>up in praise</hi> and thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to God. I admire free and special Grace, that hath made such a <hi>difference</hi> betwixt you and others, where it found none. This is the Lords doing, and ought to be Marvellous in our eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> You that are <hi>under the Influence</hi> of Gods special Grace, let it appear more in your lives, you should carry it as a <hi>peculiar People</hi> indeed. What singular thing do you? What do you more than others? If the Lord hath done that for thee, which he doth for few in the world, does but for a few in comparison; he expects that thou shouldst do more for him. Thou shouldst carry it so as few in the word do. O that you would not think it enough with your <hi>Tongues</hi> to own, and plead for special Grace, but that your <hi>Lives</hi> might be a good proof of it;
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:34554:93"/>Christians, <hi>Experimental Philosophy</hi> takes with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny now of late: O that more were for Experimental Divinity, <hi>Experimental</hi> Christianity! And so for this Point of special Grace, I wish that you and I could give the world <hi>Experiments</hi> upon it, clearly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them, that there must be such a thing indeed. O! let others <hi>see the Grace</hi> of God among us. As was seen there, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.23. Let the world see that in you, (Christians) which corrupt Nature, which Flesh and Blood would never produce. If you have <hi>known and felt</hi> the Influence of special Grace, I beseech you, let it appear, that you have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>this Grace in vain.</hi> Let it appear in your more singular Piety, exemplary Strictness, Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Humility, Self-denial, Mortification, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the world, extraordinary Fruitfulness in good Works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They that are yet <hi>short of Grace</hi> may see, whither they are to go for it: Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, (those better things that accompany Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation) are not of <hi>our selves:</hi> No, they are the Gifts of God, and of his special Grace.</p>
               <p>Sinner, How is it? Art thou convinced of the Necessity of Faith, Repentance, Holiness, <hi>without which</hi> thou canst have no true Hope of Future Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness? And dost thou see thy self short of these; and so still under <hi>Condemnation,</hi> being Sentenced by the Law and Covenant of Works, and not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming up to the <hi>Terms of the Gospel</hi> and Covenant of Grace (the only way to get freed from Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?) And art thou sensible, not only of thy <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing short</hi> of what the Covenant of Grace requires; but of thy own Insufficiency to attain to it, as of thy self? Dost thou see a wretched <hi>Indisposition,</hi>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:34554:94"/>and Aversness to thy Duty, a Cross and Crooked perverse Inclination to what would <hi>Ruine</hi> thee? Yet do not dispaire, there is hope in <hi>Israel</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this thing. And if thou art <hi>sensible</hi> of thy own wretchedness, and canst be perswaded to apply thy self to God, the God <hi>of all Grace,</hi> there is hope concerning thee: That God who hath been oft found of them that <hi>seek him not,</hi> if now thou wouldst seek and sue to him, it may be hoped, he would not deny to be found of thee, see <hi>Isaiah</hi> 65.1. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.27. He that had but one Talent is blamed and condemned, that he went not with it to the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changer,</hi> that is, says one, to the <hi>Promiser,</hi> who might have furnished him with a Forreign supply. Seek to God in the use of means: None will deny, but it is in thy power, to use the means, wherein God is wont to work Grace. It's good <hi>being in the way as Jesus passeth by.</hi> That Grace which is not in thy power to command, yet thou hast encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>to Beg;</hi> in as much as it is promised to some, and for any thing thou knowest, to thee among the rest; and this brings me to another Proposition.</p>

               <p>
                  <q>In the Covenant of Grace not any Condition to be performed on mans part. No, there is no more for him to do, but only to know and believe, that Christ hath done all for him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is downright <hi>Antinomianism:</hi> And observe, he plainly <hi>contradicts</hi> himself: First, saying, <hi>[In the Covenant of Grace there is no condition to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med on mans part.]</hi> And then presently unsaying it again, [No, there is <hi>no more</hi> for him to do, but <hi>only to Know and Believe,</hi> that Christ hath done all for him.] Where he seemeth to grant <hi>Faith</hi> to be required of man, only he giveth an unsound De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of it.</p>
               <p>But does not Gods <hi>taking away the stony</hi> heart, and giving a new heart, imply his giving Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance? And his causing some <hi>to walk in his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,</hi> imply his enabling them to yield sincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience? And <hi>what Laws are meant,</hi> which the Lord doth promise to write in the Heart? Are they not the same Laws, which were written in Tables of Stone? And to what end doth God promise to do this for some, but that he might <hi>be their God,</hi> and they be his People? Thereby shewing what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of those, who would have him for their God, and would be his People. Certainly, there is no Condition required of us in the Covenant of Grace, which is not here <hi>implied;</hi> where this is also Expressed, that God himself hath undertaken
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:34554:95"/>for some, to vouchsafe that Grace to them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they shall certainly perform the said Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>As Dr. <hi>Preston,</hi> of the New Covenant, <hi>p.</hi> 389. speaking of Repentance, he saith, It is part of the Covenant both on Gods part, and on ours. The condition required of us in the Covenant, is <hi>Doing of this,</hi> the Action. But the <hi>Ability</hi> whereby we perform that which is required, is part of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant on Gods part.</p>
               <p>Therefore if any ask,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether these Scriptures do not contain the substance of the Covenant of Grace?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Yea, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. containeth the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works, where <hi>some part</hi> of it is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and the rest included and implied. Or as <hi>Isa.</hi> 58.6, 7. containeth a <hi>true Fast,</hi> that is, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing what was taken for granted. Or as Faith is defined in <hi>John</hi> 8.24. and 11.27. where it is set forth as an Assent to this Proposition, [that Jesus is the Christ, he that should come, <hi>&amp;c.] Supposing</hi> what was taken for granted, and expressing what was then most questioned.</p>
               <p>The truth is, the <hi>Jews</hi> were a <hi>self-confident</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple generally; confident of their own Ability to keep the Law (not understanding the <hi>extent</hi> of the Law) as they were confident of their own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, if they kept the Letter of the Law. They were not come to see, and say, as <hi>Isa.</hi> 45.24. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>in the Lord have I righteousness and strength.</hi> If they were but Righteous according to the Letter of the Law, they thought that enough. They <hi>generally</hi> rested in outward circumcision. They thought it enough to offer the <hi>Ritual Sacrifices,</hi> not
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:34554:96"/>regarding to offer unto God that more pleasing <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Sacrifice</hi> of an <hi>humble,</hi> broken, obedient heart. And thus they brake the Covenant, which yet they gloried in. Therefore the Lord declares, that the days should come, when there should be a clearer Discovery of <hi>the Nature,</hi> true intent and meaning of his Covenant, that he was not a Jew, who was one outwardly, nor was that <hi>Circumcision,</hi> which was outward in the Flesh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29.) And shews here that there should be more abundant Grace given out, where they should perform what the Lord required in his Covenant, that as they had the <hi>Law written</hi> in Tables of Stone before, so they should have it written in their Hearts. And this is called a <hi>New Covenant</hi> here, as the Command to Love one another is called a <hi>New Commandment,</hi> though it was given of old; being now more <hi>Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striously</hi> set forth and commended to us, by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Christs Love to us. So had the Lord promised before of old to <hi>Circumcise their Hearts,</hi> Deut. 30.6. which is the same in sence with this promise of <hi>Writing his Law in their hearts:</hi> But though it was promised of old, yet it is here spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, as <hi>a New Covenant;</hi> because it was to be Communicated to more, and in a larger Measure <hi>under the Gospel.</hi> As it might well seem New, the like being never seen before.</p>
               <p>But is it not fairly Implyed here, that they that would have God for their God indeed, must have new Hearts, must be new Creatures, must walk in his Statutes, must <hi>lead new Lives?</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause none would attain to <hi>of themselves,</hi> and yet God will have a people in the world, therefore he <hi>undertakes</hi> to prepare them for himself, and to work
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:34554:96"/>that in them, which else-where he plainly <hi>requireth</hi> of them. And therefore we must conclude, it is a Wresting of these Scriptures, for any hence to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, that the Covenant of Grace is <hi>absolute,</hi> which evidently supposes Conditions. And by the like Reasoning one may conclude, that Justification, and Remission of sins is promised <hi>absolutely,</hi> from <hi>Isa.</hi> 43.25. <hi>I, even I am he, that blotteth out thy Transgressions for mine own sake, and will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy sins.</hi> Here Pardon of sin is promised, and no condition <hi>expressed;</hi> yet they are very great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mistaken, who have hereupon ranked this among absolute Promises. 'Tis a most <hi>free</hi> and gracious promise, yet not an <hi>absolute</hi> promise. There is a condition always understood, which other Scriptures clearly <hi>express.</hi> Surely, we may not exclude Christs satisfaction, and say that God pardoneth sinners without <hi>any respect</hi> at all had to that, because there is not any mention of it here; neither may we <hi>exclude Faith,</hi> Repentance from being Conditions of Pardon, because not expressed here.</p>
               <p>I hope these things considered it will appear, that <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. will not prove the Covenant of Grace absolute.</p>

Some, yea and those men of singular worth and eminency, will not allow this of God's giving a new heart, &amp;c. to be so much as a promise; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>quoad nos</hi> without any determinate object: none can claim by it, or plead <hi>interest</hi> in it till such time as it be fulfilled. Yet methinks it is sufficient, that it is a <hi>signification,</hi> or declaration of Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to bestow such grace upon the Elect, that his <hi>truth and faithfullness</hi> are engaged to bestow it on them, though the Lord only knoweth who they are.</p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:34554:97"/>
               <p>When the Lord promised unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> to be his God, and the God of <hi>his seed,</hi> was not here a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> when yet God had the determining of the <hi>object?</hi> The Lord had set down which of his seed they were, that should have him for <hi>their God.</hi> As <hi>Abraham</hi> had other sons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides <hi>Isaac;</hi> yet God restrained the promise to his seed by <hi>Isaac, Rom.</hi> 9.7. As afterwards it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to the posterity of <hi>Jacob, was not Esau Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs brother?</hi> And yet that the purpose of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Election might stand, it was said; <hi>[Iacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated,] Rom.</hi> 9.11, 12, 13. So when God promised, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.15. to give the land of <hi>Canaan to the seed</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> yet still he had the determining of it, unto which of his seed he would give it. They were of <hi>Abrahams seed</hi> whose carcases fell in the wilderness.</p>
               <p>Again, when God promised unto <hi>David,</hi> that he would set up his <hi>seed</hi> after him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.12. shall we say, this was no promise to his seed, because the <hi>individual person</hi> was not directly determined, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was not said expressely whether the eldest, or the youngest, or which of his sons it was, that should succeed <hi>David</hi> in the throne?</p>
               <p>Again, though the elect unregenerate cannot lay claim to the promise under consideration, as intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it, any more than others; yet certainly Jesus Christ <hi>may claim</hi> for them. As, if a friend hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to settle an estate upon your child, though the child may not be in a capacity to plead the promise, yet you can plead it for him.</p>
               <p>Again, when that which some call the first grace, is given unto any one according to that word <hi>[I will write my Law in their hearts]</hi> may we not then
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:34554:97"/>claim an interest in the same, for continuance in grace and <hi>perseverance?</hi> And should we not look upon it as a promise now? And if it be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged a <hi>promise,</hi> when it is fulfilled, it seems some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing strange, it should not be so before. Promises are <hi>promises</hi> before they are made good and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished, And not because they are accomplished.</p>
               <p>Methinks this is plain, that <hi>[I will write my Laws in their hearts]</hi> is more than a <hi>bare declaration</hi> of Gods work, what his <hi>work</hi> is about the conditions of the Covenant of grace, what God can do. I say more than a <hi>declaration,</hi> that without his Grace those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions cannot be performed. Is it not clearly a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of his gracious purpose, and pleasure, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying not onely what he alone can do, but more directly what he <hi>will do</hi> for some <hi>[I will]</hi> doth more directly refer to the <hi>purpose,</hi> than to the power of God. Now though as this is a discovery of <hi>Gods purpose,</hi> so far it agrees with a prophecy or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; yet as it is a discovery of <hi>Gods purpose of working grace,</hi> of bestowing good upon some of his Creatures; in this respect it is more than simply a <hi>prediction,</hi> it hath the nature of a promise.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some are troubled to know whither to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the promise of this first, special, inward, discri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating grace.</p>
               <p>Here methinks it were very strange, should we wholly exclude such promises from having any <hi>rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to, or connexion with the Covenant of Grace, which do so clearly evidence it to be a <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> indeed. What a wonderfull expression of his grace is this, that God <hi>engageth to work</hi> the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in his people! He did never undertake thus for man under the <hi>Covenant of Works.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:34554:98"/>
               <p>Now First, Supposing that Covenant betwixt God the Father and his Son Christ, God-man, or Mediatour; and it is clearly <hi>reducible</hi> to that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. Many Divines suppose (and I shall not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) a foederal transaction betwixt the Father and the Son, called the <hi>Covenant of Redemption,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God the Father is conceived to have given a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of Elect ones to Christ the Son, to be brought on <hi>infallibly</hi> to grace here, and glory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; upon condition, and in consideration, that he would <hi>redeem and satisfie</hi> for them: on the other hand, Christ is supposed to accept of these terms, being willing to make his <hi>Soul an offering</hi> for sin, that he might see his seed and bring many sons to glory. According to <hi>this hypothesis,</hi> the promise of the first grace should refer to Gods engagement and promise to his Son Christ. And though it be <hi>an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute promise</hi> in respect of these, in whom the first grace is wrought; (no condition being required in the Elect unregenerate, to interest them in it) yet in respect of Christ it was <hi>conditional;</hi> he being to give himself a ransome for them, and so to purchase grace and glory for them.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. Others distinguish betwixt an <hi>absolute Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> and the <hi>conditional</hi> Covenant. The absolute Covenant they make to be this in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. of which we are now speaking. The conditional Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, the proper Gospel-Covenant, <hi>[Believe and thou shalt be saved]</hi> But though we may grant it an absolute promise, it cannot be a Covenant if abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute.</p>

               <p n="5">5. Why may we not say that the promise of working grace in some, belongeth to the Covenant of Grace, considered <hi>as a Testament,</hi> rather than as a Covenant?

               <p>Here all is promised, not only pardon, and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation upon Repenting, Believing, but the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, an Heart to repent, and heart to believe, and perseverance in the same is likewise promised. Though <hi>considered formally</hi> as a Covenant, it speaks only on this wise: If you Believe, Repent, ye shall be saved; yet <hi>as a Testament,</hi> it hath this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to say. <q>And as for such as are given to Christ of the Father, you <hi>shall have his Grace</hi> and Spirit, to turn your hearts against your sins, and incline then towards the Lord Jesus.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Add, that these absolute promises are a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per means to bring men <hi>within the Bond</hi> of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and lead men a good step towards the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of what the Covenant of Grace <hi>promiseth.</hi> Here is set forth the spiritual Excellency of the Blessings promised in the Covenant of Grace, and <hi>the way</hi> how they may be attained and come by. What is here promised absolutely, would <hi>make way</hi> for all that good and happiness, which is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed upon such conditions. As they that look not after this <hi>Grace</hi> promised, they that care not though they miss and fall short of this; care not to <hi>frustrate</hi> to themselves the Covenant of Grace, to all its sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving intents and purposes. Miss of this Grace,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:34554:99"/>and you miss of all subsequent Benefits and Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, which depend on it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The last thing I shall speak to, concerning these Promises, is, <hi>what use</hi> may be made thereof, though no Unregenerate person can possibly say that he is there intended. Now to the Question.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest. What use</hi> can Unregenerate men make of these Promises, who know not that they are intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I shall premise two or three things, and then shew of what use they are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The promise of a new Heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is an <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute</hi> promise. I have told you so again and again, and will now spend a little time to clear it. When God promiseth to <hi>give a new heart,</hi> he promiseth this absolutely. This must either be promised <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely,</hi> or not <hi>at all. Gratia prima, quae preveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, item{que} operans dici solet, omnimoda est gratuita.— Omnes actus, &amp; dispositiones nostras praevenit &amp; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teit,— ut pote quae ex Deo tantum, non etiam ex nobis pendet.</hi> Alting. Elenet. p. 800. Or else we must hold with the <hi>Semi-Pelagians, Initium â nobis, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementum â Deo,</hi> If there be no true spiritual good in a man, till the Lord works it, how can we possibly imagine any condition required to his giving this Grace, except we would have Gods own Act, the condition of his further Actings. <hi>Non de nostrae voluntatis potestate, sed de sua prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinatione promisit, promisit enim quod Ipse factu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus fuerat, non quod Homines. Quia etsi faciunt homines bona quae pertinent ad colendum Deum, ipse facit ut illi faciant quae praecepit, non illi faciunt ut ipse faciat quod promisit.</hi> Aug. <hi>de praedest.</hi> Apud Bedam <hi>ad</hi> Rom. 4. f. 20. H.</p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:34554:100"/>
               <p>Certainly, here the preparation of the heart is of the Lord. The <hi>heart of stone</hi> would never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it self for Mollifying Grace. They that would make the promise <hi>conditionall</hi> thus, I will take away the stony heart, if you do not put a Bar, would <hi>make just nothing</hi> of it. As if God should say, I'le take away the stony heart, if you do not put a stony heart in my way; I'le do it, when it is <hi>done to my hands.</hi> The work shall be properly yours; yet I will have the praise. Do not they wrong our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God, who would <hi>put such a sence</hi> on his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Promise, as if he promised no more, than to take away the heart of stone, and give a new heart, if <hi>we put no Bar;</hi> Alas, it is plain, he must give a new heart, before we shall cease putting the Bar of astony, and rebellious heart in his way.</p>
               <p>And what sence is this, I le write my Law in your heart, if you have it in your heart to keep my Law? If you <hi>have a will</hi> to obey, I'le give you a will to obey. I'le Circumcise your heart to love me, if you <hi>put not the Bar</hi> of an Uncircumcised heart in my way. That is as if Divine Grace only made such willing, as it first found <hi>not unwilling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As our Divines, who were present at the <hi>Synod of Dort, Promissiones Dei aliae sunt de fine, aliae de mediis ad finem; promissiones de fine,</hi> v. 9. <hi>de salute sunt conditionatae [crede, &amp; salvaberis] Esto fidelis ad mortem (seu persevera) &amp; dabo tibi coronam vitae.] Cum autem nemo par sit conditionibus prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standis, Deus quo{que} promissiones fecit liberrimas &amp; absolutas de dandis ipsis conditionibus; quas ipse in nobis efficit, ut per ipsas, tanquam per media, possimus ad finem pertingere.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But none have ground to hope that God should work Grace in them, who will not attend on the means of Grace, and will not seek and sue to him for Grace. Then are not <hi>these Conditions?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I confess, attendance on the Word and Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are necessary, which Natural men must be called unto: Being 1. Part of the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> Duty. Some of that Homage all men owe to God. 2. The ordinary way and <hi>method,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God works upon the souls of his Elect. And upon the former account, to neglect the means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be a <hi>Contempt</hi> of God: As upon the latter it apppears to be a tempting of him.</p>
               <p>And yet that these are not conditions of Gods bestowing the first Grace is very evident, For, 1. If this was <hi>Conditio cum quâ,</hi> God should never deny his Grace to them that attend on the Outward means, use Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. If it was <hi>Conditio sine quâ non,</hi> he should never vouchsafe Converting Grace to any, who do not wait on the means. Now both these are false. Sometimes God is <hi>found</hi> even
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:34554:101"/>of them that seek him not. Though this must be be acknowledged the <hi>ordinary Method</hi> and way, wherein Gods Grace is bestowed; that they that come to the Means, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not so <hi>far from the Kingdom of God,</hi> as others, who are Despisers of the Word, and neglect Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Lord goes out of his <hi>ordinary way,</hi> as we see in the Apostle <hi>Pauls</hi> conversion. The Lord met with him, when he was Runing away from him, or rather running furiously upon him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God having absolutely promised this Grace, it shall <hi>certainly be conferred</hi> on all those, who are intended in the Promise. Otherwise God should <hi>change his mind,</hi> or his word should fail. There is no saying here, that men may put a Bar. If God should fail <hi>of performing</hi> what he hath absolutely promised; then where were his Power, or Truth, or Immutability?</p>
               <p>And therefore I cannot but wonder, that any should deny the special Grace of God <hi>determining mans will</hi> in Conversion. Mark the consequence of it. If when the Lord hath done all, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth him to do, to convert a sinner, it still de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the sinners free will to determine the business,
<note place="margin">

Arnold.</note> whether to turn to God, or not; and it may be, that two Persons have <hi>equal prevenient Grace,</hi> and the one turns to God, and the other does not, will it not follow, that God promiseth <hi>to do more,</hi> than he can perform? Which I hope they would dread to say, and abhor as blasphemous.</p>
               <p>And yet I can see no way in the world to avoid the Consequence, admitting their Doctrine.

               <p>Were it thus indeed, that when God hath done <hi>all be can</hi> to convert a sinner; hath done as much for me, or thee, this way, as ever he doeth, or <hi>can do for</hi> any; yet he must ask our leave to make his Grace Efficacious and Converting, and if we please, all he can do this way, shall be to no purpose, the work shall not be done; I dread to say what would follow hereupon. How could he either promise, or predict this concerning any, that they should turn to him?</p>
               <p>This way which many are so taken with, most certainly leadeth to one of these <hi>strange conclusions.</hi> Either, 1. That men may have a <hi>new heart given them,</hi> and <hi>Gods Law written</hi> there, and yet not turn to God, or be in a state of Grace; Or, 2. That notwithstanding God hath <hi>promised</hi> concerning some that he would give them a new heart, and put his Law in their inward parts; yet it might so <hi>fall out</hi> and happen, that not one in the world should ever have this new heart given, or the Law of God In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven in him.</p>
               <p>And whereas they will not allow the new heart promised to the Elect, as a <hi>Fruit of Electing</hi> love, but rather make it a ground of Election, make Election to depend on it; how Inconsistant is their Method with Gods Method, with the Scripture-Method? John 6.37. <hi>All that the Father giveth me shall come unto me.</hi> John 10.26. <hi>Ye believe not,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:34554:102"/>because ye are not of my sheep. My sheep hear my Voice and follow me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Observe hence, The sheep of Christ are they, that are given him of the Father. And they that are given him of the Father are his sheep. These are <hi>Reciprocal</hi> terms. Again, all that are the sheep of Christ, that are given to Christ, <hi>shall come</hi> to him, shall believe in him. Again, these only do come to him, <hi>none but these</hi> come on to Faith in him. Again, men are not given to Christ, or his sheep by coming to him, or because they believe in him: But because they are his sheep, given to him of the Father, <hi>therefore</hi> they shall come, therefore they shall hear his Voice, and follow him. <hi>Neque oves dicuntur, quam Deus previdit credituros, nam &amp; haec oratio nimium dilata esset, vos non creditis, quia Deus non previdit vos credituros, nam contra, Deus praevidit non credituros, quia non sunt credituri.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Therefore the Elect are the Persons directly and fully intended in this <hi>promise</hi> of Gods giving a new heart, and it is sure to be fulfilled and made good to them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Yet they can no more lay claim to this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, as made for them, than others may do, <hi>while</hi> they are Unregenerate. And the reason is plain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause while they are <hi>Ʋnregenerate,</hi> they cannot know that they are of the number of Gods Elect.</p>
               <p>These things premised, I shall briefly declare the use of these absolute promises, in these following Conclusions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are of use to all alike for Conviction. As implying mans <hi>Insufficiency</hi> to perform his duty here of himself, in regard of his <hi>moral, inseperable</hi> indisposedness, and aversness thereunto. No na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:34554:102"/>man can amend his own heart, or make it new. Was the Law in our hand, there had been no need for God to promise, that he would give a new heart.</p>
               <p n="2">2. These promises are of like use to all for dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. As shewing, whither, and to whom we must <hi>go for Grace,</hi> when sensible of our desperate corrupt estate hy Nature. Our only way is to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to the God</hi> of all grace. As <hi>Ephraim</hi> did, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18. <hi>Turn thou me,</hi> and <hi>I shall be turned. Tanta est ejus miscricordia, ut sit primus in Conversione, &amp; adjutorio nostro, juxta illud.</hi> Thren. 5.21. <hi>Est ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ultimus in desertione,</hi> &amp;c. Tena <hi>in</hi> Heb. p. 640. b.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They are of like use to all for general Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement. They hold forth the same <hi>general En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement</hi> to others, as to the Elect unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, They are so proposed, that as none are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, none are expressably excluded. As no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate person can <hi>positively conclude,</hi> that the Lord hath this Grace in store for Him, intended for Him in particular; so none have ground utterly <hi>to despaire,</hi> unless they were sure, it could not be.</p>
               <p>The promise of giving, or working Grace is so <hi>contrived</hi> and <hi>proposed,</hi> that it leaveth men without excuse, who do not seriously, and in good earnest seek to God for it,</p>
               <p>There is no <hi>laying the blame</hi> on Gods Decree, that the Lord never intended to give you Grace, and therefore it would have been <hi>but in vain,</hi> for you to have applied your selves to him. Certainly, here is enough to stop your mouths.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God hath Commanded you to use the means for the obtaining of Grace. As one observes: <q>Gods <hi>bare Command</hi> is a sufficient encouragement
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:34554:103"/>to him that obeyeth it, to hope, that it shall not be <hi>in vain.</hi> Especially when God denieth no man the grace to believe, but those that by abuse of former helps do <hi>(sensu Evangelico)</hi> deserve that denial.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That God hath promised to give his saving, sanctifying Grace to some. This is some more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to seek special and saving Grace in the use and improvement of Common, Preparatory Grace.</p>
               <p>God has <hi>promised absolutely</hi> to bestow his Grace on some; and you were never told the contrary, but that he might have this <hi>Blessing in store</hi> for you. And therefore it is manifest, if you look not out, if you <hi>cry not to God</hi> for it, you will be most justly condemned for your gross negligence and careless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, yea, for a plain <hi>contempt of his Grace,</hi> in not putting forth your selves to the utmost of your power, to obtain it.</p>
               <p>As you are Creatures, it is your duty to attend to the <hi>Will of God revealed,</hi> and to carry it sutably thereunto. And here, in the case before us, should we not take notice of the <hi>least gracious Hints,</hi> he gives us, and improve them to the furthest?</p>
               <p>This is plain, men are not put to a stand in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matters, they will not <hi>demur</hi> upon it, whether they shall Labour in their Callings, or no; because they know not, whether God hath <hi>Decreed</hi> to Bless and prosper them. Why then do any frame such an Objection against themselves, to take them off from <hi>looking out for saving Grace,</hi> which is of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivably greater concernment to us to look after, than any thing in the world besides.</p>
               <p>And, as an able Pen expresseth it: <q>Though God
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:34554:103"/>have not flatly engaged himself to Unbelievers,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxt. <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect. for getting peace.</hi> p. 62.</note> so as to give them a certainty of hearing their Prayers, and giving them true Grace, on the improvement of their Naturals; yet he hath not only <hi>appointed</hi> this and other means to get Grace, but also given them half promises, or strong pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities of speeding.— For as he appointeth not any vain means to man, so no man <hi>can name</hi> that man, who did improve his Naturals to the utmost, <hi>and sought God in Prayer</hi> so far as a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man may do, who yet missed of Grace, and was rejected. This is the <hi>true mean</hi> (says he) between <hi>Pelagianism,</hi> and <hi>Antinomianism</hi> in this point.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And any of you, that begin to feel sin a burden, and are sadly <hi>perplexed in spirit,</hi> seeing your selves born down with the strength and prevalency of your Corruptions, and Temptations together; yet be not utterly discouraged. Consider what Grace the Lord hath promised, he would vouchsafe <hi>to some,</hi> without any thing in them foregoing, as a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or meet qualification. And is there not ground of hope concerning thee, if now thou hast a heart to look out after his Grace?</p>
               <p>Certainly, there are many exceeding hot in their pursuit after worldly things, and <hi>yet lose their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi> quite, have their designs frustrated, and miss of their expectations. But can you tell of any one Soul, that hath sincerely, and in <hi>good earnest</hi> sought for Grace, and yet been disappointed? Many seek it remissy, and <hi>heartlesly,</hi> and miss of it; but the more diligent and earnest we are here, the more ground to hope, we shall obtain it.</p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:34554:104"/>
               <p>Now to close this Discourse. You have heard of <hi>our Misery</hi> by the Breach of the Covenant of works; of our <hi>Insufficiency</hi> of our selves to perform the condition of the Covenant of Grace, from whence alone is our <hi>remedy:</hi> Now let your want, and need of Grace, engage you to a serious and diligent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on the means of Grace, and quicken you in good earnest to apply your selves to the Throne of Grace for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi>
                  <q>But if the promise of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the first Grace be absolute,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Friendly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</hi> p. 45.</note> it's more than needs, nay, than is good: For we ought to have no respect to these things, but to the Freeness of the Promise.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This which I call you to, is <hi>no more than needeth,</hi> in other respects; though it is not any thing an Unregenerate man can do, that will give him a <hi>Title to the Promise,</hi> neither is there any Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Congruity in this. Yet it is the Duty of men Unregenerate, which they are all tied and <hi>bound to,</hi> though God is not tied and <hi>bound to</hi> them upon it, so much as by promise. But there is more hopes of your Conversion, if you are <hi>in the way,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God is oft pleased to meet with sinners, and to bring them home to himself. More hopes, He will be found of those that seek, than of those that do not seek him. Though God worketh Grace, <hi>without any</hi> Merit in, or any Condition required of, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yet not <hi>without means.</hi> Therefore they that use the means, are nearer to the obtaining of Grace, than those that neglect the means.</p>

                  <hi>PROP. X.</hi> That Grace whereby the Elect performeth the Condition of the Covenant, was purchased by Christ for them.</head>
               <p>THey that go the <hi>high Arminian</hi> way, hold that Christ Died for all, and every <hi>one alike;</hi> that is, that by his Death he Impetrated Remission and Salvation for all men, <hi>if they Believe:</hi> Not that he purchased that Grace for any, whereby they shall certainly Believe. And so with them, <hi>[Fieri potest ut impetratio sarta tecta maneat, suisque numeris perfecta constet, etiamsi increduli omnes manentes nulli forte essent, qui fructum ejus impetrationis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incredulitatem suam propriam perceperent.</hi> v. Pelt. Hac. p. 131. Notwithstanding all that Christ hath procured by his Death, it might so fall out yet, that not one in the world should be saved.</p>
               <p>Now these, howsoever they may seem to enlarge <hi>the extent</hi> of Christs death, yet they really enervate the merit, and weaken the <hi>efficacy</hi> of his death. If this be all that Christ impetrated by his death, that God might <hi>salvâ justitiâ,</hi> with safety to his justice, and honour, make a new Covenant with fallen man, come upon <hi>new terms</hi> with him, and save him, if he believeth, and sincerely obeyeth; I say if this was all, then Christ might <hi>attain his end in dying,</hi> and the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:34554:105"/>death of Christ might have its full effect, and yet not one soul saved by it. Now what a <hi>faint cause</hi> of salvation must that needs be, which being put, yet it doth not follow, that any one in the world shall <hi>certainly</hi> be saved? yet thus it must be, if the death of Christ, extendeth not further, than to make <hi>this a truth,</hi> that <hi>[whosoever believeth, shall be saved]</hi> without purchasing for any the grace whereby they shall believe.</p>
               <p>And as much as they think, that their way tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth most to the <hi>honour of Christ</hi> our Saviour, yet in truth it tendeth to his great dishonour. For so they would make Christ a Saviour, <hi>Nomine non re,</hi> a ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tular Saviour, purchasing a Salvation for all, without any full and certain intention of applying it to any. To say that he would be <hi>a Saviour</hi> as well, though not one should be saved by his death; is not this to <hi>mock Christ,</hi> as they mocked him who put on him a scarlet Robe, and put a reed in his hand, and said, <hi>Hail King of the Jews?</hi> And thus they that believe and are saved, should not <hi>owe one jot more</hi> to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his death, than they who perish, and are dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; now is not this a wrong to Christ? If Christ in dying, had not an eye to the salvation of one more than of another: but had respect to all <hi>alike,</hi> impetrated for all <hi>alike;</hi> if he merited no more for the Elect than he did for Reprobates; then the one are no <hi>more bound to him,</hi> for his Love in dying, than the other. Which I wonder how a true believer should hear with patience, and without abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency.</p>
               <p>Though I confess, they that go the middle way, do not (that I can find) so rob Christs death of its vertue and efficacy, or deny its proper <hi>causal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence</hi>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:34554:105"/>into our salvation, holding, that Christ dyed for all so far, as to procure a conditional pardon for them; and this Law of Grace, that whosoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth shall be saved: but withall, that in dying he had a further aim, a <hi>special eye</hi> of respect towards the Elect, to procure their certain performing of the condition, and so their salvation infallibly. That he died not onely that men might be salvable, <hi>Sed ut reapse &amp; certissimé semen ex sanguine videret,</hi> that those who were given him of the Father, might be certainly redeemed, actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally saved by him

               <p>Now while so much is granted us, we will freely grant, that the death of Christ is a satisfaction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly sufficient <hi>for all</hi> the sinners in the world: there needeth no other satisfaction to be added, to make it availe to the <hi>redemption</hi> and salvation of more. God is so well pleased with the Sacrifice of his Son, that for his sake he is ready to be reconciled unto any that come to God by him. And no sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner perisheth for this cause, that the satisfaction of Christ was insufficient, or not of so <hi>large extent,</hi> as to reach him: but through his own default, falling short of what is required to our having <hi>Actual benefit</hi> by Christs Satisfaction. The blood of Christ is <hi>sufficient</hi> to cleanse every one of us from all our sins: onely they deprive themselves of the saving benefit of his death, they render it <hi>ineffectual</hi> as to themselves, who trample it under foot. The most <hi>Soveraign remedy</hi> does the Patient no good, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing applyed and made use of.</p>
               <p>But notwithstanding, sinners dye, not because there <hi>is no remedy</hi> for them, no possibility of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:34554:106"/>but because they doe not apply themselves to the <hi>Physitian,</hi> nor seek to be saved in that way, wherein alone they can be saved; yet Christ died <hi>not alike</hi> for the salvation of all. Christ laid down his life for his sheep, with another manner of intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than he laid down his life for the world. He is so the Saviour of his body the Church, as he is not the Saviour of the world.</p>
               <p>That he laid down his life for his sheep, not onely to purchase remission, and salvation for them <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally (scil.)</hi> if they believe: but to procure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and salvation for them most certainly and <hi>infallibly,</hi> and so to procure the working of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of salvation in them, to me seemeth plain and clear, from plentifull testimony of Scripture. <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.10. <hi>When thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed.</hi> As sure as Christ was made an offering for sin, so sure it is, that he shall see his seed, <hi>as a fruit of</hi> his death, This is contrary to what some teach, that Christ might have his design in dying, and his death attain its end, and have its sull effect, though what Christ did impetrate should not come to be applyed to any soul in the world. Now if it were so, how should Christ <hi>see his seed?</hi> And no doubt, but Christ merited so much, that his labour should not <hi>be in vain, nor his strength be spent for nought, and in vain: but that Israel should be gathered by him,</hi> gathered to him, and that he should be <hi>for a light for the Gentiles, and for salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ends of the earth, Isa.</hi> 49.4, 5, 6. As he saith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.32. And I, <hi>if I be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me;</hi> where by lifting up from the earth, we are to understand, not his Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but his <hi>Crucifixion</hi> (as is evident from <hi>ver.</hi> 33.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:34554:106"/>So the drawing of sinners unto Christ, even of all that are drawn is made a <hi>fruit,</hi> and consequent of his death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</hi> He died, not onely that all who turn from iniquity, might be redeemed from wrath to come, but also to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem his people from iniquity, and so from wrath to come. Therefor his Name was called <hi>Jesus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was to <hi>save his people from their sins.</hi> He was to destroy the works of the devil: and did spoil Principalities and powers, triumphing over them in his cross, when <hi>his heel</hi> was bruised, (when he suffered in his humanity the lowest part of him,) then he brake the <hi>Serpents head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He died, not onely to purchase happiness for his people in the end, but also to procure holiness for them, <hi>as the way and means,</hi> necessarily conducing to that end. He gave himself (as we hear before) to Purifie to himself a peculiar people, Zealous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He is made unto us <hi>Sanctification,</hi> as well as <hi>Righteousness,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.31. He gave himself for the Church, that he might Sanctifie it, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.25, 26. We owe it unto Christ that any of us are <hi>Sanctified,</hi> as well as that we are <hi>justified.</hi> Christ shed his Blood, for his people to <hi>wash in,</hi> and be clean. As from his side pierced, there came forth <hi>Blood and Water,</hi> John 19.34. This shadows out the Virtue and Efficacy of his Death, his shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his most pure, and precious Blood, being not only for the <hi>Expiating</hi> of Guilt and purifying of the Conscience; but also for cleansing the heart, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.4.

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:34554:107"/>to intimate, that it is only in and <hi>through Christ,</hi> that any come to be Sanctified. And though we are not <hi>Elected for Christ,</hi> yet we are renewed and sanctified, and so may be said to be Elected unto Holiness <hi>through</hi> and for him. That God never intended to bestow saving, sanctifying Grace on any of us, but upon the <hi>account of Christ,</hi> see 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. The holy calling is <hi>given in Christ Jesus,</hi> and Grace given in Christ Jesus, see <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.56.

So Repentance is from Christ; from Christ, <hi>as a Saviour:</hi> Repentance is aswel from him, as Remission of sins, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31. By him we are brought into a <hi>state of Grace,</hi> Rom. 5.2. And when he led Captivity Captive, he received Gifts for men, yea, for the Rebellious also, that the Lord God <hi>might dwell among them,</hi> Psal 68.19. (to which the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> seemeth to allude, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.33.) And we read of Christs <hi>sending the Spirit,</hi> John 15.26. The Comforter, <hi>whom I will send</hi> unto you from the Father. And John 14.26. He is sent in <hi>Christs Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And may we pray for the Spirit in <hi>Christs Name?</hi> may we pray for Grace, ask Faith in <hi>Christs Name?</hi> If so, would not it imply, it was purchased by Christ for some?</p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:34554:107"/>
               <p>Whatsoever we ask, we should ask in the Name of Christ, we must ask <hi>in his Name,</hi> if we would receive, <hi>John</hi> 14.13. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.23. Now what is it to ask <hi>in the Name</hi> of Christ, if it be not to plead, insist, and depend <hi>on the Worthiness,</hi> and Merit of Christ, with allowance from him, for the obtaining of what we want, and desire? When we ask <hi>in his Name,</hi> we eye him in his Mediatory Undertaking. As he is the Son of God, and very <hi>God,</hi> equal with his Father, so we <hi>pray to him,</hi> and he properly answers Prayer. But as he is <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour,</hi> so we put up our Prayers <hi>not to him,</hi> but to <hi>God through him;</hi> I say we pray <hi>to him as God.</hi> We do not pray in his Name: as <hi>Mediator,</hi> we pray <hi>not to him,</hi> but pray <hi>in his Name.</hi> Now if we may pray for Grace in the Name of Christ Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, that Argues it is a thing merited by him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> It was purchased, but <hi>conditionally;</hi> that is, if men resist not Gods Call, and thus put a Bar to his Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Will any say so? That is to say, Christ hath <hi>purchased</hi> the Grace for men, whereby they shall believe, upon condition they shall be dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to believe <hi>of themselves.</hi> They that do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist Gods Call, obey it: And they that obey Gods Call to believe, do believe. Thus if Christ should have purchased Faith for us only <hi>Conditionally,</hi> if we do not resist Gods Call; the meaning were, and it would come to no more but this,

                     <hi>Vid. Thes. Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur. par.</hi> 4. p. 142. sect. 14.</note> he hath purchased Grace for us, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we should come to Believe, if we Believe.</p>
               <p>Again, may we suppose, that Christ Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedeth on the behalf of any? as <hi>Psal.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Ask of
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:34554:108"/>me, and I will give thee the Heathen for thine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.</hi> John 17.17. <hi>Sanctifie them through thy truth.</hi> Ver. 19, 20. <hi>For their sakes I sanctifie my self, that they also might be sanctified through the Truth. Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word,</hi> Luke 22.32. <hi>I have prayed for thee</hi> (Peter) <hi>that thy faith fail not.</hi> Now if these are things for which Christ intercedeth, they are things Merited by him. Christs Intercession is like an <hi>Advocates pleading,</hi> who hath Law and Right on his side, not like a <hi>Beggars craving,</hi> Heb. 9.24. Is not his Appearance in Heaven a continual <hi>real Pleading</hi> for his people? How? As a <hi>presenting</hi> to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers view and remembrance, what he had done and <hi>suffered</hi> upon Earth, for the Redemption and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his People. Has not his <hi>Blood</hi> a Voice? Yea, a <hi>louder Voice</hi> than the blood of <hi>Abel;</hi> only it <hi>speaketh better things,</hi> Heb. 12.24. If Christs Intercession be nothing else, but a pleading of his Merits, then what he <hi>Intercedeth</hi> for, he Merited. Those Divines that are for Christs Interceding in Heaven by an <hi>Express</hi> and open <hi>Representation</hi> of his will to the Father: Yet make his Death the ground of his Intercession. That Christ fervently and immoveably willeth and desireth this and that of the Father, for the sake, and Virtue of his Death, and Sacrifice. So that if he <hi>Intercede</hi> for the Conversion of any, he <hi>Merited</hi> their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; if he Intercede for the sanctification of any, and for their <hi>Confirmation</hi> in Grace to the end, that their Faith may not fail, he Merited so much for them.</p>
               <p>And so no doubt, that Jesus Christ, the Eternal, and only begotten Son of God, who was <hi>One</hi> in
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:34554:108"/>Essence, and <hi>Equal</hi> in Power and Glory with the Father, that he should take Mans nature on him, and <hi>give his Life</hi> a Ransome for many; even he who was worth Ten Thousand Worlds of such as we are, that he out of <hi>his Zeal</hi> for the Honour of God, to clear and satisfie his Justice, and to make way for the glorious Manifestation <hi>of his Grace</hi> and Mercy, and also out of Love and <hi>Compassion</hi> towards poor pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing Creatures, (such Love as was stronger than Death;) I say, that he upon such principles and considerations, should so willingly Die for sinners, and bear the wrath of God, which sin <hi>deserved,</hi> to make way for sinners Reconciliation unto God, and their Eternal salvation: This was such a <hi>worthy undertaking,</hi> and so highly well pleasing unto God, as deserved indeed, that his Labour and Sufferings should not be <hi>in vain,</hi> as to the Actual Redemption and certain Salvation of some. Nor is it to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that Christ would lay down his Life meerly to make men <hi>salvable,</hi> but that he had good assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that it should be to the certain salvation of many, that his Blood should not be as <hi>Water spilt</hi> upon the ground. Can we think that he would have Died upon such Terms, as it should be <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi> for men to be saved by him; and yet <hi>contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi> and doubtful, whether any one in the world should be saved? It is not a meer possibility of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, but Actual redemption, that the Saints in Heaven praise and extol him for, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9.12. <hi>Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receive Power, and Honour, and Glory: For thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy Blood, out of every Kindred, and Tongue, and People, and Nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if Christ did not (in dying for them) intend
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:34554:109"/>their certain Actual Redemption, he only intended a <hi>lesser kindness,</hi> to wit, what was extended to those that perish, in common with them: but the far <hi>greater kindness</hi> happens to them besides his Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which they might probably enough have mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of, for any thing that Christ did <hi>peculiarly</hi> for them; and which the other might as well have gone away withal.</p>
               <p>Hence says one, <q>Methinks an <hi>Arminian</hi> can hardly bear a part with the Redeemed in that Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant <hi>Song,</hi> while he thinks in his heart, he is no more beholden to the Lamb for his Redemption,

               </p>
               <p>One thing more I pray take notice of. He that could satisfie for others, could as well <hi>Merit</hi> for others. It was as much, to satisfie for our sins, as to merit and <hi>purchase</hi> saving <hi>Grace</hi> for us: It was as easie for the Lord Jesus Christ to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase that Grace for the Elect, whereby they should Infallibly be brought on to Faith, and so to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as to purchase Remission and Salvation for men, <hi>upon condition</hi> that they believe. And me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, it was necessary to make him a compleat and <hi>perfect Saviour,</hi> that he should do the One, as well as the other. And they would seem not to consult the Honour of our Redeemer so much as they ought, that make his Death a <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for sin, but deny it to be Meritorious of Grace. It was a Meritorious satisfaction. As it was <hi>satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory</hi> for sin; so it was <hi>Meritorious</hi> of that saving Grace, without which his people could have had no benefit by his Death, as <hi>a satisfaction.</hi> As it was satisfactory, it was to Exempt and Deliver
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:34554:109"/>us from the <hi>great evîl</hi> and misery, we were Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious unto; as it was Meritorious, it procured that Good and Happiness, we want. Thus Christs Death was not only to redeem us from the Curse due to sin, <hi>but to redeem us unto God.</hi> His Blood was not only to pay our Debts, but to purchase a new Stock, and a surer Estate for his People, than that we had lost.</p>
               <p>Since the writing of these Notes, I met with one,
<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>J. H. Middle Way of Elect. and Redempt.</hi> p. 29.</note> quite of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perswasion, who holdeth that the <hi>Merit,</hi> or purchase of Christs Death, or the Price he laid down for our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was not offered to the Father, to procure of him, that he should <hi>give Faith,</hi> and Repentance to any; but that he should give <hi>Remission</hi> to those that repent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For which he Argues modestly thus, 1. <q>The holding otherwise makes Christs Redemption a <hi>double thing. Answ.</hi>
                  </q> And so the Scripture seems to make it. Teaching in some places, that he gave himself a Ransome <hi>for All,</hi> for the <hi>whole World,</hi> and tasted Death <hi>for every</hi> man: And in other places, that he laid down his Life for <hi>his Sheep,</hi> for those whom the Father had given him, that he gave himself <hi>for the Church.</hi> 2. <q>It goes quite against the hair to reason, that Christ should procure the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit upon condition,</hi> and not otherwise; and yet that he should procure also the <hi>performance.</hi> To what purpose do we make such a <hi>labour about,</hi> as this?</q>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is no more against the hair, then that Christ should have the Elect <hi>especially</hi> in his Eyes; or then it is against the hair, that he should deliver them from wrath to come, by sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them from their sins. It was no <hi>Labour about,</hi> when Christ died with a <hi>special intention</hi> of redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:34554:110"/>the Elect effectually, and of being the Author of certain <hi>Actual Salvation</hi> to them, to take in, and intend the necessary means leading thereunto. 3. <q>Then there is nothing in mans salvation but of purchase, and we shall be beholden <hi>to Christ for all,</hi> and <hi>to God for nothing.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> We are never the less beholden to God, for that he <hi>gave his son Jesus Christ</hi> to be our Saviour, and to do all this for us. Surely, the Father is to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and praised for all that Christ has done in order to our salvation, see <hi>John</hi> 6.38.39.40. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.4. Christ came into the world, to do <hi>his Fathers will,</hi> and finish <hi>the work, that his Father gave</hi> him to do. And are we not beholden to God for the <hi>pardon of sin?</hi> which this Writer grants, to have been purchased by Christs Death for those that Repent, and Believe. And <hi>Heaven,</hi> I hope, is <hi>Gods Gift,</hi> notwithstanding Christs purchase. 4. <q>The Death and Redemption of Christ is for <hi>All, for every man,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> What was said in answer to his first Reason, will take off what he says here. There was a <hi>general, and lesser be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit</hi> extended to the world by Christs Death, again there was a <hi>special and greater benefit</hi> intended to the Elect by it. The latter contains the former, not <hi>vice versâ:</hi> In regard of the former, he is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the World, in regard of the latter, the Saviour of his Body only. <hi>p.</hi> 30. <q>Gods <hi>sending his Son</hi> is one thing, and his <hi>sending his Spirit</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</q>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Yet the sending of his Son was to make way for sending of his Spirit. And the Spirit is <hi>sent in Christs Name,</hi> with what it impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, I have shewn before. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                  <q>Let it be true on the one hand that Christ by his Redemption,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:34554:110"/>hath indeed procured no more for <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> than for <hi>Judas</hi> and the Reprobate.</q>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> But that is <hi>scarce true,</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. Who <hi>loved me, and gave himself for me.</hi> I cannot think, he meant no more, than so <hi>as he loved and gave himself</hi> for all the Reprobates in the world. This would not keep <hi>up the Honour of his Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the height,</hi> as he there pretends.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 31. <q>It is true, we come in the Name of Christ, to ask his Spirit and Grace; that is, we <hi>ask it through Christs Merits.</hi>
                  </q> A fair concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (which one would think was no less than <hi>giving away his cause:</hi> But he distinguisheth here.) <q>There is the <hi>Merits of his Person,</hi> as well as the <hi>Merits of his Death.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> That there was any <hi>Merit</hi> in his Death, it was from the <hi>Worthiness</hi> of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. But why could not Christ have procured our Reconciliation to God, and Salvation, by the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his Person,</hi> as well as the effectual Vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? And thus would not this Writer make Christs <hi>Death and Oblation,</hi> as he insinuates, that others make some part of his Mediatorship, <hi>more than needs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 33, 34. <q>I must offer moreover, If Christ had purchased Faith and Repentance for some, which all have not, the Reprobate might here <hi>have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to say,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> No more to say, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Gods Decree of Election, which yet he maintains. Will he allow the Reprobate to say, That the reason why he repented not, as the Elect did, is because God had <hi>decreed</hi> to give Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to one of them, and not to the other. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Reasoning here, in regard of Gods decree of Election (which he holds with us) Christs Purchase and Redemption should as well be a
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:34554:111"/>
                  <hi>mock to the Reprobate.</hi> But as God hath intended and promised, and Christ hath purchased Faith and Repentance for the Elect, so that they <hi>come certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> to <hi>believe</hi> and repent; they owe it unto Gods Grace, and Christs purchase. And as for others that <hi>fall short of Grace</hi> here, and so of Salvation hereafter, it is <hi>through their own fault.</hi> God, and Christ have done enough to leave them all without Excuse.</p>
               <p>Other things I pass by, being spoken to before.</p>
               <p>Now this Proposition, that Christ is the purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser of Grace, may be of good use. As</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) This speaks encouragement to poor destres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed souls, who have a deep sense both of their own <hi>weakness</hi> and <hi>unworthiness.</hi> Though thou art ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so unworthy of Grace, yet Jesus <hi>Christ is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> for whose sake it may be freely Imparted to thee. Grant, that thou art unworthy, that he should own thee; yet surely he hath deserved to have a people in the world, that should own him indeed, believe on him and submit to him. He is <hi>worthy</hi> to have a people to serve and Honour him. And he hath taught us to pray, <hi>[Thy Kingdom come,]</hi> though we are unworthy to be Translated into his Kingdom. He is worthy to be our Ruler, though we are <hi>unworthy</hi> to be acknowledged by him, as his Loyal Subjects. He that hath Fought for us, Died for us, is worthy to be <hi>our Head,</hi> though we are unworthy to be his Members. Well, here is Encouragement for such as begin to <hi>enquire after</hi> him, only they fear, they should have no part in him, sear that they shall be rejected of him: Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if thou canst not be <hi>satisfied without</hi> Christ and his Grace, it is a sign, the Lord hath begun with
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:34554:111"/>thee, to bring thee over to himself. It is to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped thou art part of Christs purchase, which he will not lose. Converts are the Travel of his soul, And he is abundantly <hi>satisfied,</hi> to see this Fruit of his sorrows. When souls become willing to bow to his Scepter. It is the <hi>day of Christs</hi> Power, <hi>Psal.</hi> 110.3. It is the day of Christs <hi>glorious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,</hi> and Triumph; it is as a <hi>Coronation day</hi> to Christ, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.11. The day of the gladness of his Heart. Let the thoughts of thy former unworthy carriage and disposition be <hi>humble,</hi> but not <hi>discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage</hi> thee. Remember, that he hath received Gifts for men, yea, for the Rebellious also, that the Lord God may dwell among them. He hath <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued</hi> many a rebellious Creature by his Grace, and made them Loyal Subjects. And if now thou art lamenting after him, it is to be hoped, he is at work with thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But they are so <hi>very few in comparison,</hi> that ever attain to an Interest in Christ, and saving Grace, that I know not how to hope, it should be ever so well with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If they were never so few, yet while there are any, and so long as the thing is possible, thou art to seek it above all things in the world: And if thou must die and perish, yet thou shouldst resolve to die and <hi>perish in pursuit</hi> after Christ, and Grace. If any place of Profit or Honour be to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of, many will presently <hi>put</hi> in for it, will make Friends, and employ their Wit and Interest to obtain it; many will seek, though but one can go away with it: But here all that seek Christ and Grace aright, are in the way to find him.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) You that are partaking of Christs purchase,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:34554:112"/>that have received some Grace of his Fulness; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <hi>where you had it,</hi> and be, 1. Humble. 2. Thankful. 3. Watchful.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Be Humble, you may not say, my hand hath got me this wealth: <hi>Now I live,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Be Thankful, O how thankful should you be <hi>for Christ,</hi> and how thankful <hi>to him?</hi> What praise is due to him, who hath loved us, and <hi>washed us from our sins in his own</hi> Blood, and sanctified us?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Be Watchful, to preserve Grace. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what it cost: As <hi>David</hi> said of the water of the West of <hi>Bethlchem, Is it not the blood</hi> of the men, that went in Jeopardy of their Lives? O precious Faith, which cost the precious Blood of Christ, to purchase it! when you are <hi>careless</hi> of maintaining and preserving Grace received, would not this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, that you have very low thoughts of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase of Christs Blood? Did he not think it too much, to shed his Blood, to procure Grace and Peace for thee: And dost thou think <hi>any pains</hi> too much to preserve thine? Does not that deserve to be cherished with our Prayers and Tears, which cost the Blood of Christ, to procure it for us?</p>

               <p>INdeed a Learned man observes, that according to <hi>Distributive</hi>-Governing-Justice, so <hi>Adam</hi> might have been said to Merit, doing all that could equally be required of him; that is, keeping the Law of Innocency.

As <hi>Beza</hi> in <hi>Luke</hi> 17.10. <hi>Sed &amp; ipse Legis contextus omnem merendi dignitatem excludit: Nihil nisi prorsus gratuitam benig nitatem promittens ipsam observantibus: Cum ipsum quoque legale pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum non aliunde quam à mera Dei benignitate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiscatur,</hi>

Where <hi>the Condition</hi> is of Grace; the benefit promised can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be of Grace. How should that <hi>Merit</hi> for us, which is the <hi>free Gift</hi> of God, which he (of special Grace) was pleased to bestow on us?</p>
               <p n="2">2. (As we have heard also) Christ hath <hi>purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> saving sanctifying Grace for all those, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to it as well as Salvation thereupon. And hence it follows, that there is no proper <hi>Merit</hi> but <hi>in Christ.</hi> We are to thank Christ, both that we have Faith (any of us) and that Salvation is sure to them that believe. And one says well: <q>How far is the <hi>performance</hi> of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition from Meriting the thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Great. prapit.</hi> p. 198.</note> when Christ Died for this end, that God might justifie and save them that perform it.</q> Be thou faithful unto death, says Christ, <hi>and I will give thee a Crown of Life.</hi> And how impossible is it, that our being faithful unto death should Merit the <hi>Crown of Life from Christ,</hi> since it was he that purchased our Faith and Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance? Surely Christ is before-hand with us here; nor can we come ever even with him.</p>
               <p>How absurd is it to say, that Christ hath Merited this for us, that our works should Merit? Then instead of being <hi>saved</hi> by Christ, we should rather be our own <hi>Saviours.</hi> So we might say, to the works of our own hands, (dipt in Christs Blood) ye <hi>are our Saviours.</hi> And what needed Christ to have Merited Heaven for us, if we were to merit it by our own works? see <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. <hi>ult.</hi> It is called the <hi>Purchased</hi> possession, in regard of what Christ
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:34554:114"/>hath done; not that we could purchase it by any thing, <hi>we can do.</hi> And if it was purchased by Christ for the Faithful, then surely there is no need, that they should purchase it anew. If they must merit Heaven, this would deny Christs having merited it for them: I say, this were a denial of the <hi>merit</hi> of Christ, or a denial of Gods <hi>Justice</hi> in not giving Heaven to them, when it was purchased for them, except they will purchase it over again. Or else they must think, that God is <hi>behind-hand</hi> with them, if Christ hath Merited Heaven for them, and they merit Heaven themselves; <hi>one Heaven</hi> should not be enough. What enemies are they to the Grace of God, how hard would they make him, to take a <hi>double</hi> price for the same Possession?</p>
               <p>Yea, the Opinion of mens merits would make Jesus Christ the <hi>Redeemer indebted</hi> to his redeemed ones. O prodigious absurdity. Is it not plain that he hath power to give eternal life, that he gives <hi>eternal life, Joh.</hi> 17.2. And would it not be a strange mingling of heaven and earth, (horrible confusion) for a believer to come to Christ, and demand of him, Lord give me the life and happiness, which I have <hi>merited</hi> at thy thy hands? Rather is it not he, that merited for his people, and so hath it put into his hands to give them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But if salvation was purchased by Christ, for believers, will it not follow, that it is not of Grace?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> No: it is given for <hi>no merits of</hi> theirs; though for the merits of Christ. Indeed it is <hi>of Iustice</hi> to Christ, because he hath merited salvation for believers: but of <hi>grace</hi> to them, because they could no way merit it. But if one supposeth any
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:34554:115"/>merit in them; he therein denyeth, and directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth that of the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> That they are saved by grace. If of grace, then not of their own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; If of their own merit, then not of grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. How utterly impossible it is, and therefore incredible, that the most eminent Saint should <hi>merit heaven,</hi> who must (with <hi>Iacob,</hi>) acknowledge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self less than the least of mercies, and for the very least of his sins deserving <hi>no less than hell?</hi> Though his sins are pardoned, that he is not bound over to hell and condemnation; yet the <hi>reatus simplex</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, that we must say of such a pardoned sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; if God should deal with him <hi>according to his deserts,</hi> he could look for nothing but hell.</p>
               <p>If a believing, repenting sinner, if the most humble mortified sinner in the world should <hi>merit</hi> forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>life and happiness; then their must be <hi>more good</hi> ness, necessarily supposed in his faith, repentance, obedience, than there is <hi>evil</hi> in his sins: But there is more evil in one sin, than there is good in the most perfect obedience of any creature. And if there was <hi>more good</hi> in a Saints obedience, than evil in his sins; then what need had such of the satisfaction of Christ; Then Christ dyed in vain for them who might have satisfied for themselves.</p>
               <p>Again, while the sins of a believer do in their <hi>own Nature</hi> deserve hell, if he could merit heaven on the other hand by his obedience, then it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the same person, at the same time should deserve both to be pardoned, and to be condemned, should both deserve <hi>heaven and hell,</hi> so the penitent should be saved, but the sinner damned.</p>
               <p n="4">4. How impossible is it that the condition of the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:34554:115"/>Covenant of Grace should be <hi>meritorious,</hi> when this is ever necessarily included, indispensible required, as part of the condition, that we do <hi>utterly renounce our own righteousness,</hi> disclaim all self-merit, self-worthiness, that we see our misery and despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate lost estate without the free grace of God in Christ, that we freely <hi>acknowledg our iniquity,</hi> and ill deservings at Gods hand, and put no confidence in the flesh. Yea we should be ashamed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded in our selves, even when the Lord is pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards us.

               <p>NOw after man had broke with God, one would be apt to conclude, that God would never take him into a <hi>new League,</hi> unless it was upon some higher, and harder terms; as it is usual a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men. Yet it is quite otherwise in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace. God <hi>condescends</hi> to as <hi>low terms</hi> as it is possible for any man reasonably to desire. As if the Lord should treat sinners thus: <q>Poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures you have <hi>destroyed your selves;</hi> but <hi>in me is your help.</hi> You are a company of Rebels, that deserve to die, yet I am ready to pardon, and to be <hi>reconciled</hi> to you, in and through my dear Son, (who in tender compassion towards you, willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interposed betwixt you and Justice, and died to satisfie for, and save as many of you as should own him for their Redeemer, and return to their <hi>Allegeance</hi> to me.) Now here I offer to be at peace with you; only I must secure the <hi>Honour</hi> of my <hi>Free-grace,</hi> and my Sons Merits, as I must also keep up the Reputation of my <hi>just Authority,</hi>
                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:34554:118"/>Holiness, hatred of sin. (As I cannot but hate sin, though I am willing to be Reconciled to sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.) And I must have you at some <hi>better pass,</hi> not to sin wilfully, as those that neither fear to offend God, nor regard at all how they wrong their own souls. Now, what say ye? Are you ready heartily to acknowledg your sin and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, to accept of a <hi>gracious pardon,</hi> and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation offered, standing no longer in your own Justification, but utterly renouncing your own Righteousness? And do you <hi>resolve</hi> to be subject to my Authority, to obey my Commands for time to come, unfeignedly grieving and being truly humbled for your coming short, and failing in any part of that duty you owe to me your Creator, Redeemer, Owner, Governour? That is, in short, are you really <hi>willing</hi> to give up your selves to me, to be Guided and Governed by me, and saved in my own way?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Then I here, faithfully engage, upon the word of the ever Living God, the Faithful God that <hi>keepeth Covenant,</hi> that I will be your God, your Portion, your Exceeding great Reward. I will be, and do all that can be desired, to make you for ever Happy.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now is not this a fair proposal? Is it not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, that the Great God should ever make such a <hi>gracious offer</hi> to sinful, provoking Creatures? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose an Earthly Prince offering a Pardon, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising his <hi>Princely grace</hi> and favour to a company of condemned Traitors, and Rebels, if they would seriously confess their guilt, acknowledge and accept of his <hi>Princely grace</hi> and clemency, and promise Loyalty and subjection for time to come; Would
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:34554:118"/>you not say these were very fair, easie and <hi>equitable terms?</hi> And that in wisdom and honour he could require no less? And what doth the Lord <hi>require more</hi> of us? O sinner! thou that hast been a rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious wretch, what doth the Lord require of thee, but <hi>only</hi> to <hi>acknowledge</hi> thine Iniquity, to accept of Christ the only Saviour, and give up thy self to be <hi>governed by</hi> him, heartily bewailing and mourning for it; when at any time thou hast <hi>forgotten him,</hi> and that Love, Duty, Service, and Thankfulness, which thou for ever owest unto him? And is it not wonderful Grace, that <hi>on these terms</hi> the Lord is ready to receive thee? Doth he promise, that <hi>[If the wicked turn from his wickedness, and walk in Gods Statutes, he shall surely live;]</hi> his sins shall not be mentioned unto him, (as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.14, 15, 16.) And will any deny this to be a <hi>gracious promise,</hi> because conditional? Is it not plain, that what the Lord calleth for here, is of Right, and a <hi>due Debt</hi> from us? But that he promiseth to <hi>receive</hi> sinners upon <hi>their return;</hi> this is not of Debt, but of Gods abundant Mercy, and Free-grace.</p>
               <p>And how should he <hi>in Honour go lower</hi> than he doth, or <hi>in Faithfulness to the Interest</hi> of the souls of his people?</p>
               <p>These three things therefore make up the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Repentance</hi> towards God, without this no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission or Salvation: <hi>Except ye repent, ye shall sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perish.</hi> But on the contrary, <hi>If the wicked turn,</hi> he shall surely live, he shall not dye, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.21.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Faith</hi> in our Lord Jesus Christ. <hi>If ye believe not, ye shall dye in your sins, Joh.</hi> 8.24. But, <hi>Believe on the Lord Jesus,</hi> and <hi>thou shalt be saved,</hi> Act. 16.31.</p>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:34554:119"/>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>A resolution</hi> to perform sincere, and new obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.8. The Lord Jesus shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from heaven, to <hi>take vengeance on them</hi> that <hi>obey not the Gospel</hi> (that yield not <hi>evangelical obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:</hi>) But he is the <hi>Author of Eternal salvation to them that obey him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Under these three, (Repentance, Faith, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Obedience) is included whatsoever the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace requireth, and where one of these is, there are the other. They are <hi>inseparable:</hi> and where one is named, the other are understood. As what goeth under the name of faith working by love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. is called <hi>a new creature, Gal.</hi> 6.15. and <hi>keeping the commandments of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.19.</p>
               <p>Under the old Testament the condition of the Covenant of Grace is ordinarily expressed by <hi>turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, (Ezek.</hi> 33.11. <hi>Seeking him (Amos</hi> 5.4. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.17.) <hi>walking uprightly, (Gen.</hi> 17.1. <hi>Psal.</hi> 84.11. <hi>keeping his commandments, (Psal.</hi> 103.18.</p>
               <p>In the New Testament it is more ordinarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by <hi>faith, faith in Jesus Christ, Mar.</hi> 16.16. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.36. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Not but that all that were saved before Christ came in the flesh, were saved by him (who was the <hi>Lamb slain from the beginning of the world,</hi> as some take that in <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8.) not but that it was <hi>for his sake,</hi> that any were accepted of God, and saved before: see <hi>Ast.</hi> 15.11. but after his coming in the flesh, then a more <hi>explicite faith in Christ,</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of all that would have salvation by Christ. And therefore the <hi>Gospel was written</hi> (as the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist <hi>John</hi> sayes of the writing of his <hi>Gospel, Chap.</hi> 20.31. that we might believe <hi>that Jesus is the Christ,</hi> the son of God, and that <hi>believing we might have life

Therefore he saith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.3. <hi>This is life eternal to know thee, the true God, and Iesus Christ whom thou hast sent.</hi> So <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.36. <hi>He that believeth on the Son hath everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life, he that believeth not, shall not see life.</hi> So ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve what the Covenant of grace requireth for the honour of Christ as Redeemer, and of Free-grace.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant, how some have argued, an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit knowledge</hi> and belief of Christs death and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, not to have been absolutely necessary to the salvation of those, that lived <hi>before Christs coming</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet methinks, it is plain, that the faithfull, that lived and died before Christs coming in the flesh, as they <hi>had some means</hi> of attaining to the knowledge of a Redeemer, so they had some <hi>knowledge of a Redeemer,</hi> though it was <hi>more general</hi> and confused, not so clear and distinct, as what Christians now have: But the doctrine of <hi>mans Redemption</hi> was preached to <hi>Adam</hi> immediatly after his fall <hi>[The seed of the woman shall break the Serpents head]</hi> And <hi>Iob</hi> could speak of his Redeemer, <hi>Iob</hi> 29.25, 26, 27. <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth.</hi> And faithfull <hi>Abraham,</hi> Christ testifieth of him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.56. <hi>Your
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:34554:120"/>Father Abraham rejoyced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.</hi> And <hi>Iacob</hi> invocates the <hi>Angel of the Covenant, Gen.</hi> 48.15, 16. God before whom my fathers, <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Isaac</hi> did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day: <hi>[The Angel which redeemed me from all evil]</hi> bless the lads. This Angel was <hi>his Redeemer,</hi> (And so the Messiah is called, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59.20.) Again, the same Patriarch, when he lay a dying, breaks forth into this sweet note, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.18. <hi>I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord:</hi> which the two <hi>Chaldee Pharaphrasts</hi> explain thus, (as <hi>Ainsworth</hi> noteth) <q>our father <hi>Iacob</hi> said, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect not the <hi>salvation of Gideon son of Ioash,</hi> which is a temporal salvation; nor the <hi>salvation of Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> son of <hi>Manoah,</hi> but the <hi>salvation of Christ</hi> the son of <hi>David,</hi> who shall come to bring to himself the sons of <hi>Israel,</hi> whose salvation my soul desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</q> The Patriarks that <hi>dyed in the faith,</hi> saw something in the promise, which they did not live to see fulfilled, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. Though it was <hi>a far off,</hi> yet by <hi>faith</hi> they saw it, and <hi>dyed in the Faith,</hi> and confident expectation of it, as <hi>Iacob</hi> that said, <hi>I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord.</hi> As Christ told his disciples, that <hi>many Prophets,</hi> and <hi>righteous men, and Kings have desired to see the things</hi> that ye see, and have not seen them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.17. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.24. So he sayes, that the Scriptures of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>testified of him, Ioh.</hi> 5.39. and <hi>ver.</hi> 46. Had ye believed <hi>Moses, ye would have believed me, for he wrote of me, Luke</hi> 24.44, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>to him gave all the Prophets witness,</hi> Act. 3.18.20, 22. &amp; 10.43. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.69, 70, 72, Act. 7.52. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10, 11. As the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> under the Law pointed at Christ the <hi>Lamb of God,</hi> the true Sacrifice, that takes away the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:34554:120"/>sins of the world. So it was foretold, that he should <hi>make his soul an offering for sin,</hi> and bear the iniquity of his people, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.10, 11, 12. And <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.26. <hi>After sixty two weeks shall Messiah be cut off.</hi> Thus it was revealed, that he should be put to Death; yea, and that he should <hi>rise again, Psal.</hi> 16.9. <hi>Thou wilt not suffer thine holy One to see corruption.</hi> And <hi>Psal.</hi> 110.1. Setteth forth his glorious Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>The Lord said unto my Lord, sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stool.</hi> Now when so much of him was <hi>revealed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> methinks it is strange, if the Faithful then should know nothing of him. VVas the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Lord so <hi>straightned then,</hi> as not at all to own and bless his own means here?</p>
               <p>But though I confess, it is not in me to determine, <hi>how much</hi> Knowledge of, and Faith <hi>in the Messiah</hi> was necessary then; and though I grant the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallity of the Faithful then might know <hi>very little,</hi> (if any thing at all) of the <hi>way and manner</hi> of the Messiahs procuring Redemption and Salvation; of <hi>which the Prophets</hi> themselves were put to enquire, and <hi>search diligently,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.10. Yet methinks, this is very clear.</p>
               <p>That Pardoning Grace was not a thing unknown to them, but <hi>plainly declared,</hi> that they might know, Salvation was <hi>not of Works, but of Grace.</hi> As the Lord had proclaimed his Name to be The Lord, the Lord God, <hi>Merciful and Gracious, forgiving Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and Trangression, and Sin;</hi> and that will by no means clear, <hi>Mundando non mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dabit,</hi>

As <hi>David describeth Blessedness,</hi> Psal. 32.1, 2. <hi>Blessed is he, whose Transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in whose Spirit there is no guile.</hi> (i. e.) No guile allowed, but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and abhorred. So this was plainly taught, that the <hi>true Israelite,</hi> the guiltless person, the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right man could not attain to Blessedness, but by the way of <hi>pardoning Grace.</hi> So they that offered <hi>the Sacrifices of Righteousness,</hi> might not <hi>trust</hi> in their own services and sacrifices, but <hi>in the Lord,</hi> Psal. 4.5. And <hi>David</hi> (a man after Gods own heart) acknowledgeth Gods Forgiving-mercy, <hi>Psal.</hi> 103.3. Who <hi>forgiveth all thine</hi> iniquities.

And <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that the <hi>good Lord would pardon</hi> every one that prepareth his heart to seek God, 2 Chron. 30.18, 19.</p>
               <p>And thus far the condition of the Covenant of Grace was all one under both Testaments, <hi>to secure the Honour of Free-grace.</hi> (And they are utterly unworthy of any Grace and Favour from God, that will not acknowledg it.) O! How is Gods Free-grace, and Infinite mercy <hi>magnified</hi> in the Pardon
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:34554:121"/>and Salvation of a sinful Creature? Free-grace is the Attribute that God <hi>delights to Honour,</hi> and doth Honour especially in a sinners Salvation. And he will have this <hi>right done</hi> unto it, by all, that would attain to Salvation; he will have them see and acknowledge, that if ever they be saved, it must be by Gods Infinite <hi>Free-grace.</hi>

               <p>There was never any Saint, or truly Righteous person in the world, accepted, and saved <hi>for any inherent Righteousness</hi> found in him: But only of Gods Free-grace, through the satisfaction of Jesus Christ, eyed, and <hi>accepted</hi> of God for him. And we read of the Jews, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.31, 32. which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after the Law of Righteousness, that they <hi>attained not</hi> to the Law of Righteousness: Because they sought it not by Faith, but as it were by <hi>the works of the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This therefore is <hi>essential</hi> to the condition of the Covenant of Grace, that we acknowledge all that God doth for us, according to this Covenant, or all that he here promiseth to do, to be of Grace, <hi>of Free-grace.</hi> And if men could do all, that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:34554:122"/>requireth besides this, and then rest in the same, as a <hi>satisfaction</hi> to God for their sins, and a <hi>compensation</hi> for his Favours, as making him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends; this were to turn the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> into a <hi>Covenant of Works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This you are to note, (and I pray you observe it.) The condition of the Covenant of Grace, is not to <hi>satisfie for</hi> our breach of the Covenant of VVorks, but to <hi>Interest us</hi> in Christs <hi>satisfaction.</hi> It being so <hi>agreed betwixt,</hi> or <hi>decreed by</hi> God the Father, and his Son Christ, that none shall be pardoned and saved upon account of his <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> but only such as come up to the Tearms of the Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p>And truly the Design of the Covenant of Grace is so clear for <hi>advancing Christ,</hi> and <hi>Free-grace;</hi> that after many deliberate thoughts, I am afraid to give any more to <hi>Faith it self,</hi> in the business of a sinners Justification and Salvation, than our sober Divines give to <hi>Repentance,</hi> and other Graces. Upon serious thoughts, I dare not contend for any Causality, or <hi>Efficiency</hi> in Faith it self; no, not in the least and lowest Degree. If in any respect it is to be <hi>preferred</hi> to other Graces, it is in this (to use the phrase of a Learned Divine) that <q>It is <hi>the sinners Self-denying acknowledgment</hi> of his sin and misery, and inability to help himself.</q> Not that Faith could <hi>of it self</hi> procure our Pardon and Justification: But only God hath promised to them that believe, an Interest in Christ, and his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness. How doth <hi>Faith Interest</hi> us in Christ and his Righteousness for Justification, and Salvation? Certainly, not by any <hi>Intrinsick virtue</hi> of its own, but by <hi>virtue of Gods gracious promise.</hi> The Papists
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:34554:122"/>would have Faith to Justifie, as it is a Grace dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing <hi>ad justitium,</hi> and as a part of our Inherent Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness: <hi>Justificatio sine dubio motus quidam est de peccato ad justitiam,</hi> says Bellarmine. So he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destandeth that of being Justified freely by his Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. <hi>Per gratiam, idest, per justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam ab illo donatam, &amp; infusam.</hi> But if we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of their notion of Justification (more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Justification) then we should be Justified <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> and necessarily upon the Working, or (to use the common word) Infusing of a principle of Grace, or <hi>Righteous habits.</hi> As it followeth also, that we can only be said to be <hi>justified in part,</hi> till such time as our Inherent Righteousness be perfect. And consquently that <hi>in part</hi> we are all Unjustified; and so all should be liable to Condemnation still.</p>
               <p>Others speak of the <hi>Tò credere,</hi> the condition of the Covenant of Grace, Justifying, God taking and accepting of it, <hi>as if it were a perfect fulfilling</hi> of the Law. Thus Faith by <hi>Acceptilation</hi> is suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to stand in the place, and stead of Perfect, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act, Legal Righteousness and Obedience. And I confess the Expression of Faith being <hi>counted for Righteousness,</hi> Rom. 4.3, 5. would seem to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance such an Opinion, at first blush. But we must not put <hi>such a sence on</hi> this Text, and expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Scripture, as would overthrow other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. We read 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. That Christ is <hi>made of God unto us Righteousness.</hi> VVhere <hi>Bellarmine</hi> grants, <hi>Non esset absurdum, si quis diceret nobis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putari, Christi justitiam &amp; merita, cum nobis do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentur &amp; applicentur, ac si nos ipsi Deo satisfecisse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus:</hi> Though it be a giving up his cause. But they that place Faith in the room of <hi>perfect Obedience,</hi>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:34554:123"/>teaching that by Gods gracious Acceptilation the one is reputed for the other. they <hi>wrest the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and deny the gracious Imputation of Christs Righteousness to them that believe.</p>
               <p>So far as I am able to apprehend, that which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth to the Righteousness, and Obedience, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> is the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and Satisfaction of Jesus Christ alone, (who is called, The Lord <hi>our Righteousness,</hi> who is made of God unto us Righteousness, our Pro-legal Righteousness, as one.) As also we are said to be made the <hi>Righteousness</hi> of God in him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21.) That as man should have been Justified, and for ever Happy by the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> for his own Righteousness inherent in him, and wrought by him, had he obeyed perfectly: So that any man is Justified, and saved now, it is not for any imperfect Inherent righteousness of his own, but for the Righteousness of Christ alone. his compleat and full <hi>satisfaction</hi> to Gods Law and Justice. But now if you ask, How the Righteousness, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of Christ <hi>becomes ours,</hi> to Justification and salvation? Or how it cometh to be imputed to the Justifying of some, when it is <hi>not imputed</hi> to others? The answer is, because the Lord hath set down in the Covenant of Grace upon <hi>what tearms,</hi> or in what way the Righteousness of Christ shall become ours to Justification, and salvation; and some come up to <hi>those terms,</hi> others not.</p>
               <p>And so the expression of faith being accounted, or <hi>imputed unto righteousness</hi>] must either be <hi>an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pallage,</hi> (as <hi>Beza,</hi> &amp;c.) meaning that righteousness is imputed <hi>to them that believe, Rom.</hi> 4.11. or faith must be put there for the <hi>object of faith,</hi> Christ ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:34554:123"/>and received by faith, or else the words may be understood thus, that faith is that, which in the <hi>eye of the new Law</hi> passeth for righteousness, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to Christs righteousness. Being <hi>all (sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily)</hi> which is required of a man himself, that he may be <hi>just</hi> in the eye of the <hi>new law</hi> of Grace, or the Gospel, or that he may have a <hi>right</hi> and <hi>title</hi> to the righteousness, which consists in the remission of sins through Christ, (see Mr. <hi>Allens</hi> Discourse, <hi>p.</hi> 48.49, 50.) But the words cannot possibly be intended by the Apostle, <hi>to exclude Christs Righteousness</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to them that believe, for that would make him contradictory to himself.</p>
               <p>And so I conclude, that faith is not instead <hi>of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Legal righteousness:</hi> but the righteousness of Christ, which is imputed to us, <hi>(made ours)</hi> when we believe, come up to Covenant-terms. So we read in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. Christ is the end of the Law <hi>for righteousness to every one that believeth,</hi> and <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.3.4. what the law could not do, in that it was <hi>weak through the flesh,</hi> God sending his own son in the likeness of sinfull flesh, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and a sin-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; or a <hi>sacrifice for sin,</hi> (as it should have been translated, and I wonder <hi>Beza</hi> should oppose it, when in <hi>his note</hi> upon <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.6. He is contrary to himself and readeth <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>sacrifice for sin.</hi> (But God sending his own Son, to be a <hi>sacrifice for sin,</hi> thus he) condemned sin in the flesh; That the <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Law</hi> might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. As if he had said, The Law and justice are <hi>no Losers by us,</hi> who are in Christ Jesus. Though our obedience be imperfect and short of the Rule; yet Christs satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction <hi>is full and perfect,</hi> which by Gods gracious
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:34554:124"/>promise and Covenant, is freely made over to all that believe.</p>
               <p>But thus you have heard how the design of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace is to <hi>advance Gods free grace,</hi> and the merits of Jesus Christ, and accordingly it is a main <hi>es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential part</hi> of the condition of the Covenant, that we acknowledge free grace the <hi>moving,</hi> &amp; Christs righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness the <hi>meritorious</hi> procuring cause of all that good, and blessedness proposed, and promised in the Covenant. As they are altogether unmeet to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of such benefits, as will not acknowledge from whom they receive, and how they come by them.</p>
               <p>Now to apply this, before I proceed to that part of the condition, which is a <hi>recognizing</hi> of Gods Authority, and swearing fealty to him.</p>
               <p>Let me ask, <hi>what spirit</hi> you are of? Have you high thoughts of your selves, and would you be something in your selves? or have you learnt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny your selves, and to have <hi>admiring</hi> thoughts of Christ, and free Grace? <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.9. &amp;c. There our Saviour put forth a parable to certain that <hi>trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in themselves that they were righteous.</hi> Two men went up into the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee, the other a Publican. The Pharisee stood and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thus, <hi>God I thank thee,</hi> that I am not as other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this Publican. I fast twice in the week, &amp;c. And he <hi>trusted in this,</hi> thought this enough to commend him to Gods acceptance, and to procure his salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He looked no further. The poor Publican he stood afar off, and would not lift up so much as his <hi>eyes to heaven,</hi> but smote upon his breast, saying, God be mercifull to me a sinner. He saw himself a <hi>lost undone</hi> creature, unless it would please the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:34554:124"/>Lord to shew forth his wonderfull free mercy. He had a <hi>deep sense</hi> of his own wretchedness, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness. Now saith our Saviour, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. I tell you, this man went away <hi>justified, rather than the other.</hi> For every one that exalteth himself shall be abased, and he that humbleth himself shall be exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Now Sirs, how is it? Are we <hi>for exalting</hi> our selves, or for exalting Christ, and grace? It is true, naturally we are all for establishing, and setting up our <hi>own righteousness;</hi> and are loth to own our poverty and wretchedness, to be so great, as indeed it is; are loth to think of being so much beholden to Jesus Christ, and free Grace, as indeed we must be, if ever we be saved. But know this, it is as certainly <hi>damning</hi> for men to <hi>trust in</hi> their own righteousness, as to <hi>go on impenitently</hi> in sin and wickedness. It may be because thou art not <hi>so bad</hi> as others, thou thinkest thy self <hi>too good to go to hell:</hi> that thy sins do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve hel; or it may be thou hast been <hi>humbled after a sort,</hi> &amp; hast reformed many things, hast left thyswear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cursing, lying, thy drunkenness, thy open Sabbath profanation; &amp; now thou livest after <hi>another fashion,</hi> thou art a diligent hearer, hast set up the worship of God in thy family, art just in thy dealings, &amp;c. and therefore now thou thinkest, thou <hi>deservest well</hi> at Gods hand. But alas, one thing thou lackest, thou must <hi>sell all,</hi> and <hi>come to Christ.</hi> Thou must count all things <hi>dung,</hi> thine own righteousness <hi>filthy rags,</hi> and desire only to be found <hi>cloathed in</hi> the righteousness of Christ. Alas, alas, while thou trustest in thy self, as having such a righteousness of thine own, thou art upon a <hi>false bottom,</hi> thou art but a proud Pharisee, and many Publicans are more likely to enter into heaven, than such <hi>self-righteous</hi> ones. If when
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:34554:125"/>we cannot deny, but we are sinners; instead of humbling our selves before God, and <hi>suing to him</hi> for Grace and pardon, in and through Christ (the way that he hath set forth, wherein alone sinners may be reconciled to him.) VVe will go <hi>our own way</hi> (as if Gods way were too low) so we will think to <hi>make God amends</hi> some other way; what is this, but to deny Pardoning, Gospel-grace, and (as one says) to <hi>spit in Christs face?</hi> VVhat is this, but to make the Death and satisfaction of Christ needless? As what needed Jesus Christ to Die for sinners, <hi>to satisfie</hi> Gods Justice, if any thing that sinners can do, may satisfie? VVell sirs, look to it: Christs satisfaction was never <hi>intended,</hi> or provided for such, as think themselves <hi>sufficient</hi> to satisfie, and <hi>make God amends;</hi> such as hope their sins are not so great, but they may be <hi>Expiated</hi> by their good prayers, works of Charity, or Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, that they have done. VVere it so indeed, then Jesus Christ might very well have spared his great pains taken, and undergone about it.</p>
               <p>The truth is, there are very gross and dangerous mistakes both ways: Too many that would <hi>take Christs work</hi> out of his Hands, as <hi>Self-justiciaries;</hi> others again would cast that, which is their own <hi>proper work,</hi> upon Christ, as <hi>Antinomians.</hi> The sound Christian must warily avoid both these Rocks, both Extreams.</p>
               <p>Indeed Christ hath satisfied for us, for our breach of the Covenant of VVorks, if we perform the condition of the Covenant of Grace. But he hath not performed the condition of the Covenant of Grace for any (though he hath <hi>purchased</hi> that Grace for some, whereby they shall perform it.) But
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:34554:125"/>Christ was made <hi>under the Law,</hi> to fulfil the Law: Not under the Gospel, to perform the condition of the Gospel. He hath not <hi>repented for us, believed</hi> for us. Had he done these, then there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all for us to do; but he should <hi>save us</hi> alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <hi>without us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Christ's satisfying for mans breach of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, will not exempt us from a necessity of performing the condition of the Covenant of Grace. As our performing the condition of the Covenant of Grace, is <hi>not that which satisfieth</hi> for our breach of the Covenant of Works. Sirs, be very clear in these points: Certainly, they are of very <hi>great weight.</hi> Suppose I am questioned, as <hi>being a sinner;</hi> what have I to plead here, but the satisfaction of Christ? But then suppose my <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in Christs satisfaction</hi> questioned; in this case I have nothing to <hi>plead,</hi> but the condition of the Covenant of Grace. If I truly repent, and believe, then by <hi>Gods promise,</hi> and Covenant, I am assured of Remission and salvation by Christ. But for us to place any Act, <hi>Grace,</hi> or Duty of ours in the room of Christ, is a most dreadful presumption, and an <hi>undoing mistake.</hi> They that here would turn Christ <hi>out of Office</hi> may indeed expect, that he will <hi>turn them off</hi> to shift for themselves. They that are not willing to be saved by him, and saved in his way, <hi>cannot be saved.</hi> So necessary it is, that we all come to a deep sense of our own wretchedness, and unworthiness, and to be heartily willing that Christ and <hi>Free-grace</hi> should have all the Honour of our Justification, and salvation. As a personal wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness, so a <hi>conceit of such</hi> worthiness in our selves, will not stand with a Covenant of Grace, or with salvation by Grace.</p>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:34554:126"/>
               <p>Pardon, and peace with God, and Heavens ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Happiness, are <hi>too precious</hi> Priviledges and Blessings, to be cast away on such, as have no sense <hi>what it cost</hi> Jesus Christ to purchase them, and such as make <hi>light matters</hi> of them; and such as are so well conceited of themselves, as to look upon all as Deserved, and Due to them. The <hi>Water of Life</hi> is for souls that are <hi>a thirst.</hi> And Christs Wine and Milk for them that have <hi>no Money</hi> to buy. They that come with the Prodigal, <hi>Give me the portion of Goods that falleth to me;</hi> that think they may lay claim to Heaven, as their own, as a due Debt, shall go without it: They have <hi>no part,</hi> nor lot in it. Rather it is meet to come to God with the returning Prodigal, heartily confessing; Father, <hi>I have sinned</hi> against Heaven, and before thee, and <hi>am no more worthy</hi> to be called thy son, or to have any portion, or Inheritance among the children. Job 33.27, 28. <hi>He looketh upon men, and if any say I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profiteth me not: He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the Light.</hi> Now,</p>
               <p n="2">2. I come to speak of the condition of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, to shew what it requireth, to <hi>keep up Gods Authority;</hi> and evidence his Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Holiness, and Hatred of sin. (As I have told you, though he is willing to be Reconciled to sinners, yet he can never be <hi>Reconciled to sin.</hi> As I also told you in my Discourse of the Covenant of Works, that God in entering into Covenant with man, did not lay aside his Authority, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Power over man.)</p>
               <p>I confess I meet with one of very great worth,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:34554:126"/>that makes faith the <hi>onely condition.</hi>
                  <q>Faith,
<note place="margin">Mr. Obad. Sedgw. <hi>of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> pag. 183. 185.</note> and no other thing.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, faith considered only <hi>as uniting us to Christ;</hi> (which he sayes is a point as difficult, and weighty as any that he meets with) <q>Faith <hi>as justifying,</hi> doth not bring us into Covenant, (sayes he) for our justifying follows our being in the Covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> where by <hi>being in Covenant,</hi> (as all along in his Treatise) he meaneth, being <hi>internally</hi> in Covenant, or keeping, and standing to the Covenant, so that one may lay claim to the blessings promised in the Covenant.</p>
               <p>But I would fain know, whether souls are <hi>united to</hi> Christ by any other faith, than such a faith, as justifieth, and sanctifieth too?</p>
               <p>And elsewhere the same Authour telleth us, <q>All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though forgiveness of sin be not the <hi>effect</hi> of mans <hi>repentance,</hi> (for then we should forgive our selves, yet repentance is required <hi>to the</hi> obtaining of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness; citing those texts, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.7. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.21.</q>
                  <hi>If the wicked will turn</hi>—where it is plainly made <hi>the condition:</hi> And, if faith be any more, if remission and justification be <hi>the effect</hi> of mans faith, (then as he saith) we should forgive our selves, and <hi>justifie our selves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, where he is proving <hi>a condition,</hi> expresly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in Scripture, (as agreeing to the Covenant of Grace,) amongst other texts, <hi>requiring faith,</hi> he citeth these, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38, 43, 19. <hi>Repent and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17, 18. Come out from among them—and <hi>touch not the unclean thing,</hi> and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:34554:127"/>Sons and daughters, <hi>saith the Lord Almighty;</hi>] which Scriptures make <hi>repentance,</hi> and <hi>conversion,</hi> as well the condition of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>If now you should say, that you know not what to think of the <hi>Condition</hi> of the Covenant of grace. And Ministers distract your minds, saying some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is <hi>this thing onely,</hi> and sometimes it consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of other things, as well as that.</p>
               <p>Yet know, we are all agreed thus far, that where <hi>one grace</hi> is in truth, there are other graces with it. Where <hi>saving Faith</hi> is, there is repentance, and a disposition and resolution to perform <hi>sincere obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> They are <hi>inseparable.</hi> As Moralists speak of a concatenation of <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">So the Stoicks, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Diog. Laert. in Zeno. l. 7. p. 513.</note>, there must needs be a <hi>concatenation of saving graces</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed the seed of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all graces in it. And all graces make one <hi>new creature.</hi> The <hi>new heart</hi> is both a believing heart, and an humble; a penitent heart, and a pure; and a loving heart, and a thankful heart; &amp;c. And so he that will have <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>no other thing,</hi> the condition of the Covenant of Grace; yet afterwards telleth you what it is, to wit, "the bringing of the heart into Christ.</p>
               <p>Because I have long had the same apprehensions touching this matter, I will recite his words at large, thinking them <hi>very well worthy</hi> of your observation: when he is speaking of the <hi>principle of grace,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing, saving grace; says he, <q>According to the several <hi>wayes of working,</hi> it hath several names, (e. g.) As it is the turning of the heart; it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>conversion.</hi> As it is the humbling of the heart;
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:34554:127"/>it is called godly sorrow. As it is the the turning of us from sin, it is called Repentance. As it is the bringing of the heart into Christ, it is called <hi>Faith, &amp;c.</hi> As it is the abasing of the heart, it is called <hi>Humility.</hi> As it is the gentle tempering of the heart, it is called meekness. As it is a submitting of the heart to God in sufferings, it is called <hi>patience, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Now if you attend to this; that all grace is <hi>radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi> or virtually in that <hi>seed of God,</hi> you will know what to say to those nice questions, whether faith or repentance be first? And whether we are <hi>first united</hi> to Christ by; and then receive sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing graces from him? It quite cutteth off such questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as these. As that faith, which <hi>uniteth unto</hi> Christ, supposeth the understanding enlightned, and the will set right; that is, the soul <hi>renewed.</hi> So that question, whether faith be seated in the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or in the will? would appear to be an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent question. As many Philosophers of late can see no reason to suppose those faculties <hi>really distinct</hi> from the soul.</p>
               <p>Methinks, this may ease your minds of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, that the <hi>seeming difference</hi> among sober Divines, about the condition of the Covenant, may occasion. Take notice of this I pray; they that make faith the <hi>onely condition,</hi> yet are far from sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing that faith goes alone; No, it hath the whole <hi>train of graces</hi> attending on it. The new heart, that which the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> calleth, a divine, or <hi>Godlike Nature,</hi> hath them all.</p>
               <p>Another sound Divine I meet with,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bulkley of Covenant, p.</hi> 334. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> makes faith <hi>the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> of the Covenant of grace,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:34554:128"/>but there he takes Faith in so <hi>large a sence,</hi> as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>sincere Obedience.</hi> And so he telleth us, when God saith in the Covenant <hi>[I will be your God,]</hi> the meaning is not only, that he will be a <hi>God of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> to us, to pardon and bless us; but a God <hi>over us,</hi> to <hi>Rule and Govern us:</hi> And that Faith closeth with him in <hi>both respects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He grants, <q>The Covenant betwixt God and us, is, like that between a King and his People, Faith sets God upon <hi>the Throne,</hi> and saith, <hi>Reign thou over me.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And again, <q>If he do at all make a Covenant with us, he will be a <hi>God to us,</hi> as well <hi>to Rule</hi> us, as <hi>to save us;</hi> to say, Live as ye will, yet you shall be saved, is the <hi>Devils covenant,</hi> not Gods.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now I would not take such for Adversaries, who agree <hi>in the thing,</hi> only they differ in words, in the manner of expressing themselves.</p>
               <p>Faith indeed is the only Receptive condition. As in its own Nature it is an Accepting or Receiving of Christ offered in the Gospel, in which respect it is chosen and appointed by God, and is the great Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary condition of the Gospel: But then besides Faith, (the Receptive condition) there are other Dispositive conditions, which are either necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implied, and included in Faith, or are necessary Attendants on it. For which see what the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17.1. <hi>I am the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> or All-sufficient <hi>God, walk before me, and be thou perfect.</hi> Or be <hi>sincere, upright.</hi> Or [be thou perfect] though thou art not <hi>already perfect,</hi> yet be pressing on towards Perfection. As it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Note of Sincerity and Uprightness, to <hi>strive after Perfection.</hi> And no less is required of us,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:34554:128"/>2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. Having therefore these Promises, (wha Promises? Those <hi>Covenant promises</hi> mentioned, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.16, 17, 18.) let us cleanse our selves from all Filthiness, and be <hi>perfecting Holiness,</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the fear of God. Though we are not perfect in Holiness, while here, yet we must be <hi>perfecting Holiness:</hi> This is required of all Gods Covenant People. And who are they that deal not falsly in his Covenant, but such as <hi>walk uprightly,</hi> whose hearts depart not from him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 44.17, 18. Who are they that <hi>keep his Covenant,</hi> but such as give themselves to keep his Testimonies, <hi>Psal.</hi> 25.10. Keep them, as <hi>Zacharias,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his Wife, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.6. As <hi>David,</hi> who desired to have a <hi>respect to all</hi> Gods Commands, would lay all Gods Judgments before them: Though they cannot yield <hi>sinless Obedience</hi> to any one Command, yet their desire is to Obey all Gods Commands. They Obey his Laws <hi>Impartially,</hi> though but <hi>Imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Psal. 15.1, 2. <hi>Lord, who shall dwell in thy holy Hill?</hi> VVho shall go to Heaven? The Answer is, He that <hi>walketh uprightly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what can be more plain, than that this is <hi>part of the condition</hi> of the Covenant of Grace; even from those very Texts. which may plead and urge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all conditions. They who have God for their God, whom he owneth for his People, have <hi>his Law</hi> put into their Inward parts, and written in their hearts. View over again, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. &amp;c. with the other Texts, <hi>Parallel</hi> to it, which I had occasion to speak of before, under the Ninth Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Mich.</hi> 6.6, 7, 8. VVherewithal shall I come before the Lord, will the Lord be placated, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:34554:129"/>
                  <hi>with thousands of Rams, or with ten thousands of Rivers of Oyl?</hi> Shall I give my First-born for my Transgression, the Fruit of my body, for the sin of my soul? He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and <hi>what doth the Lord require</hi> of thee, but to do Justly, and to love Mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.</p>
               <p>And surely, <hi>it is meet</hi> to be said unto God, I will not offend any more: <hi>That which I see not, teach thou me; If I have done iniquity, I will do no more,</hi> as it is <hi>Job</hi> 34.31, 32. Is it <hi>not meet,</hi> that when a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner cometh to God, desiring <hi>conditions of peace,</hi> be unfeignedly sorry for sin past, and resolved against sin for time to come, fully purposing not to persist in any way of sin: Surely <hi>it is meet</hi> to be said unto God, Lord be at peace with me, and by thy Grace I will now break my <hi>former League</hi> with sin; O! I would no more return to Folly. I would not that <hi>other Lords</hi> should any more have dominion over me.</p>
               <p>Thus now you have heard, what are the tearms of the Covenant of Grace, as to secure the Honour of Gods Free-grace, and of Christs Merits, so to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert <hi>Gods Authority</hi> over us, and evidence his Love to Holiness, and hatred of sin. And as ever you would <hi>enjoy the Blessings therein</hi> promised, as ever you would have the pardon of sin, and an Interest in God, and Eternal happiness, you must come up to these Tearms: And be <hi>it known unto you all,</hi> that if you do not like well of these Tearms, you may <hi>stick to the Covenant</hi> of Works, and from thence receive your Doom: But certainly, you cannot <hi>claim any part</hi> in that Happiness, held forth in the Covenant of Grace. God cannot in Honour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend to any <hi>lower tearms.</hi> Should he pardon
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:34554:129"/>Offenders, who had a purpose to Transgress a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, to go on in sin? would not this be an <hi>embol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening</hi> of sinners? Would not it be a stain to his Righteous Government? A great <hi>blemish</hi> to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wisdom, and Goodness too? Most true it is, his Grace is Dispensed <hi>freely,</hi> yet not <hi>promiscuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> Though the <hi>Pope</hi> is <hi>prodigal of his pardons</hi> which cost him nothing, and indeed are <hi>nothing worth;</hi> though he grant out <hi>Pardons</hi> and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations</hi> for sins to come, Sins to <hi>be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> yet the Wise and Holy God setteth more store by his <hi>Pardons.</hi> He cannot but <hi>account highly,</hi> of what was purchased at no lower Rate, than the most precious Blood of his dear Son. Of all things in the world, he cannot endure to have his <hi>Grace in Christ</hi> abused. Though he is a God that pardoneth Iniquity, Transgression and Sin, yet he will by no means clear the Guilty, or acquit the VVicked, as it is, <hi>Nah.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Ita mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricors, ut maneat justus, &amp; Sanctus.</hi> They shall not have a pardon from him, who would not care how they <hi>abused it.</hi> But only such as would say with <hi>Ezra:</hi> Should we again break his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? He healeth their Back-slidings, whom he freely loves, and graciously receives.</p>
               <p>O sirs, we (as we are Gods Messengers) should fear to conceale any part of our Message: As we are his Ambassadors, we should fear to hide from you any part of our Ambassie. Would it not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulness to God and to your souls, did we shun to <hi>declare all the</hi> Counsel of God concerning you? Well, I must tell you what you are every one of you to trust to, God hath <hi>Sworn by his Holiness,</hi> and he will not Lye, he will never alter this thing
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:34554:130"/>that is gone out of his Lips; he hath given you <hi>Propositions of peace</hi> in writing, you have the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of his Covenant, signed with his own Hand; <hi>Sealed in the Blood</hi> of his Son: You have heard the Contents what it is that the Lord requireth of you. Now what say you? Are not his <hi>Ways equal?</hi> Are not the Tearms very fair? Are not his Offers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding gracious? If you are not pleased with them, you may <hi>take your course;</hi> yet I must say, refuse them at your peril. As I must warn you, and in the <hi>Name of the Lord,</hi> I warn you this day, that you never look that he should offer Mercy to you upon other Tearms than these. I call Heaven and Earth to record against you this day, that you have had Life and Death set before you, and I <hi>warn you</hi> every one, that you do not presume of any part in Christ or Salvation purchased by him; or that any of the <hi>saving Benefits,</hi> and Blessings held forth in the Covenant of Grace, are yours, if you are not indeed sensible of the evil of sin, and <hi>truly humbled</hi> for sin if you do not truly renounce your own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and really resolve to forsake all known sin, to practise all known Duty, to walk before God, and be upright.</p>
               <p>How is it possible, that they should be <hi>true to their League</hi> with God, faithful in his Covenant, who yet continue in League with any Lust, any known sin, Gods <hi>declared enemie;</hi> and who refuse to come under any known Law of his?</p>
               <p>Know this, that as a <hi>Pharisaical</hi> righteousness cannot, so neither can an <hi>Antinomian faith</hi> save a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you. The Apostle <hi>James</hi> would tell the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines of his dayes, that the Devil had a faith as well as they. Indeed Libertines have another Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:34554:130"/>not the <hi>true Gospel</hi> of Christ. Therefore they must needs have another faith, not the true Faith of Christ.</p>
               <p>Some would perswade themselves, and others too, that Christ hath done all: That they must <hi>see their Repentance in Christ,</hi> and Gospel-obedience in Christ, which is a very short cut to Heaven. But how <hi>smooth and specious</hi> soever this Doctrine may seem to some, yet it is most false, corrupt, and dangerous Doctrine. Christ never satisfied for our full and final breach of the Covenant of Grace, though he did for our breach of the Covenant of VVorks. Not but that sins <hi>against the Gospel</hi> are pardoned for the sake of Christ. Not but that Christ satisfied for sins against the preceptive part of the Gospel, and Non-performance of the condition for a time; but these are pardoned to none, but those that come to perform the Gospel condition, that is, Believe and Repent in time.</p>
               <p>Shew me one Text, that will prove, there was ever any sinner in the world, pardoned and <hi>saved in a state of impenitency</hi> and disobedience. Christ hath told us, what is the portion of Hypocrites and Unbelievers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.51. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.46. And if any of you continue such, there you may read <hi>your Doom.</hi> Look what sentence he gives forth now in his word, he will not contradict, but fully ratifie in the last and great day.</p>
               <p>And see what he saith, Mat. 7.21. <hi>Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; but he that doth the will of my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> And Luke 19.27. <hi>Those mine enemies which would not, that I should Reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.</hi> As <hi>Jeptha</hi> said to the men of <hi>Gilead,</hi> Did ye
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:34554:131"/>not hate me, and expel me? and why do ye come to me when you are in distress? Such as reject Christ now, will find such welcome to him another day, that they shall be rejected of him. [If I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver you, shall I be your Head?] Christ will not be <hi>our Saviour</hi> upon other tearms. He will certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to be <hi>our Saviour,</hi> if we refuse him <hi>as Lord.</hi> Him God hath exalted to be a Prince, as well as a Saviour. Him God hath appointed not only to be a Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but also a Leader and Commander, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.4.</p>
               <p>And thus I have spoken of the condition, of the Covenant of Grace. 1. As securing the honour of Christ, and free-grace. 2. As securing the honour of Gods Authority and Holiness, Now</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I will add a few words concerning the condition, as it respects the <hi>Interest and benefit</hi> of souls, Are not his wayes equal, when he requires nothing, but what is for our advantage? See <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.12, 13. <hi>And now Israel what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in his wayes and to love him, to keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, which I command thee this day for thy good,</hi> So <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.24.</p>
               <p>Is it not good, that such weak imperfect creatures as we are, have our help laid on Christ, who is <hi>mighty to save?</hi> Is it not better that we have such an Alsufficient Saviour to lean upon, than to stand on our own Leggs? <hi>Tutissimum est,</hi> (As <hi>Bellarmine</hi> was forced to say at last, after a great contest against it) <hi>propter incertitudinem propriae justitiae, &amp; periculum inanis gloriae, fiduciam totam in solâ Dei misericordiâ &amp; benignitate reponere;</hi> would not any enlightened conscience chuse and think it safer to abide by the perfect righteousness and satisfaction of Christ our
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:34554:131"/>surety before Gods barre; would not such an one much rather desire to be found in that long white robe, than to be found in the short covering of his own imperfect righteousness? That to despise, slight, and reject Christ, is exceedingly to wrong our own souls?</p>
               <p>Again, is it <hi>not good</hi> that the heart be humbled for sin, broken for sin, the more to loosen it from Sin, and to engage it the more against sin for time to come? And though <hi>worldly sorrow</hi> is a burthen causing the heart to stoop; yet certainly you that know what Godly sorrow is, you find much more <hi>hearts ease</hi> in it: Have you not many times gone awy with lighter hearts, hearts more <hi>at ease,</hi> from prayer, from the word, from a Sacrament, when you have had them kindly melted into Gods sorrows?</p>
               <p>And is it <hi>not good</hi> to be divorc'd from sin? what are ye the better for any lust, you have harboured in your bosomes? Have they not been <hi>Delilah's</hi> to you? What fruit, what fruit of those base lusts? Oh how may you be ashamed! All that kindness you have shewn to your lusts, hath it not been great cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty to your own souls? How have they robbed you of your <hi>strength,</hi> of your peace, true peace and comfort, of sweet communion that you might have had with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ, and with the Holy Spirit the Comforter! O what have you <hi>lost, to enjoy</hi> your base lusts? when the Prophet saith <hi>[his soul is not right in him] Non est recta anima, Hab.</hi> 2.4. The Apostle hath it thus, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38. <hi>My soul shall have no pleasure in him,</hi> yet to the same sence, <hi>quia rectitudo animae, in semet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipsâ consistit in eo, quod placeat Deo, &amp; è contra, eo ipso quod placeat Deo, in se est recta. Lud. Tenu. in Heb.</hi> 10. <hi>dip.</hi> 7. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 473. <hi>b.</hi> And after all sin
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:34554:132"/>would rob you of your souls and ruine them for ever.</p>
               <p>Would you have <hi>Christ and your Lusts together?</hi> Heaven and your lusts together? But that is <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,</hi> Abstracting Gods decree, and positive consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, it is impossible in the very nature of the thing. <hi>[What communion hath light with darkness?]</hi> If it <hi>be good</hi> for souls to contract with Christ, to receive Christ, it is then <hi>good</hi> to break with sin, and part with sin. As Christ cannot endure his greatest ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to be his <hi>corrival;</hi> so neither can one heart be in League, in love with two, so contrary; while you love the one, you will despise, yea hate and be at Enmity with the other.</p>
               <p>And what should you do with your <hi>Lusts in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?</hi> You would find no company there, fit for you, no Objects there, no entertainment there fit for you. How miserable is <hi>Dives</hi> in Hell, with his perpetual scorching, parching thirst, while he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not obtain a drop of water there, to cool his Tongue? And would it not be a Torment to sinners to be in Heaven, with their craving Lusts, where is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing suitable to satisfie them? No fuel <hi>for Lust</hi> in Heaven; no VVork, no Employment in Heaven fit for you. O sirs, without <hi>new hearts,</hi> What should you do in the <hi>new Jerusalem?</hi> Without clean hands, and pure, holy hearts, What should you do in Gods <hi>holy Hill?</hi> If the enjoyment of Heaven be a thing desirable, then also it is desirable that we be sanctified, made meet for that Inheritance of the Saints in Light. It is impossible in the Nature of the thing, that we should be happy in the Fruition of God, till first we are made Holy, and conformed to him.</p>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:34554:132"/>
               <p>And you that have no delight in the Service of God, in holy Duties, to whom the word is a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and Prayer a burthen, and Sabbaths weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some days: Alas, what should you do in Heaven? Would those <hi>Carnal hearts</hi> of yours like well to keep an everlasting Sabbath there, that are so weary of these short Sabbaths here; saying, When will the Sabbath be ended? How would you like to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually admiring, and adoring, and extolling God and his Infinite glorious Perfections, Christ and his Incomparable, Matchless <hi>Love and Grace;</hi> as those that think Eternity too little to take the Height and Length, and Breadth and Depth thereof. Thus it may appear that what God requires in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, is plainly necessary in order to the Rectifying and Healing of mans corrupted Nature, to make it capable of true Blessedness; to make it capable of what the Covenant of Grace doth hold forth and promise.</p>
               <p>O my Friends, how easie were it Expatiating here, and to shew what <hi>enemies</hi> they are to their own souls, and what Bruitish, unreasonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures they are, that think what God requireth in the Covenant of Grace, is <hi>very hard.</hi> Surely they know not what is good for themselves. Consider once again, what it is the Lord requireth of us, and is it not, as if he should bespeak us after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Poor Creatures, though there is cause as you are Degenerated, and Apostatised from me, just cause indeed that I should sentence you to Hell, to depart from me, as accursed for ever; yet for <hi>my son's sake,</hi> and to manifest my Rich Grace and Mercy; I do here declare, I am ready <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi>
                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:34554:133"/>you again into favour, that your souls should live for ever in my Sight, and that upon as <hi>good Terms,</hi> as ever you could possibly wish for your selves. You have seen when I had put Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness <hi>into mans own hand,</hi> he soon lost it, to his undoing; well now it is in a safer hand, my Son Jesus Christ hath brought in everlasting Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness; and though you have no Inherent Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of your own that <hi>can justifie</hi> you in my sight, yet come to my Son Christ, and he hath that for you, wherein I cannot but be satisfied, and well-pleased.</p>
                  <p>Your sins have been very Injurious to you, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing my <hi>Image</hi> in you, and exposing you to my Wrath, separating betwixt you and your God, depriving you of my <hi>Gracious presence;</hi> but now heartily acknowledge and be wail them, watch and strive, and resolve against them; and though you cannot Live absolutely free from sin while here, yet your sins shall be pardoned, and sin shall not have Dominion over you, nor hinder your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with me. Do but continue Fighting, and you shall have the Victory, and Triumph at last in Glory.</p>
                  <p>You have been walking contrary to me, weary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your selves for very Vanity: O! but now at last <hi>bethink your selves,</hi> consider your Wayes, and return to me; O! forsake not your own Mercy. As averse as you have been from heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening to my Commands, yet if now at length you would <hi>encline your ear</hi> to me, you shall find that my Commandments are not grievous; no, my <hi>Yoak is easie,</hi> my Ways are Paths of Pleasantness: Not one that ever served me in Truth, that will
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:34554:133"/>say they have served an <hi>hard Master.</hi> O sinners, as ever you wish well to your selves, either here or hereafter, shake off your sins, that have corrupted and would ruine you, and take up my Yoke, and and ye shall find rest for your souls.</p>
               </q>
               <p>And now, Sirs, what can you say why you should not accept of <hi>Gods Tearms?</hi> What can you say, but that If here you turn a deaf ear to him, you indeed forsake <hi>your own</hi> Mercy to follow lying Vanities, and chuse Death rather than Life?</p>
               <p>It may be some will think I have used more words than needed, in a case so plain: But this is a <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of as great Concernment as any thing I can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly speak of, and therefore not to be sleightly pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed over.</p>
               <p>Till you come to <hi>apprehend</hi> and accept of the Tearms of the Covenant of Grace, there is no peace betwixt God and your Souls. Do you ask: <hi>Is it Peace?</hi> I must tell you: No. What Peace, so long as you sleight Christ, the only Peace-Maker? <hi>What peace,</hi> so long as you will not lay down your Arms, abandon your Lusts, and submit to Gods Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Scepter, will not be governed by his Laws, that is, so long as ye will continue Rebels? Alas, while it is thus, there is no peace. And hitherto all <hi>Treaties</hi> and Offers of Grace, all Gods gracious <hi>Parleys</hi> with thee, all the Beseechings, Pleadings, Warnings of Gods Messengers and Ambassadors have <hi>been in vain,</hi> as to thee, who art not yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to quit all thy Carnal confidences, to forsake sin, and come in to God.</p>
               <p>Yea, there is no <hi>possibility</hi> of thy Salvation upon other Tearms than these, except the Lord Jesus Christ would come again into the World, and <hi>Die
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:34554:134"/>once more,</hi> to save thee in and with thy sins, as he hath dyed to save his <hi>from their sins.</hi> But that can never be, Christ being raised from the dead, <hi>dyeth no more;</hi> and there remaineth no other sacrifice for sins, or wouldest thou have God set forth <hi>a new Gospel,</hi> and some other Covenant, but that he will never do for any sinner in the world. No: this is the <hi>everlasting Gospel.</hi> This is the new Covenant (the terms whereof you have heard opened to you) the <hi>new Covenant,</hi> that shall never <hi>wax old,</hi> to give place to another. Oh that self-confident, secure, and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous</hi> sinners might be convinced and <hi>awakned</hi> by what hath been said.</p>
               <p>As on the other hand, the poor in Spirit, the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and contrite ones should be encouraged and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted.</p>
               <p>Thou that art so much, so oft discouraged at the thoughts of thy own sinfull vileness and <hi>unworthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi> rather be encouraged, that thou seest thy own vileness, a thing which the most neither do, nor have any <hi>mind</hi> to take notice of. It is not a sinners unworthyness that barrs him from Christ, but ones <hi>presuming</hi> on his own <hi>worthiness.</hi> If now thou hast such a sense of thine own unworthiness, as hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth thee, and heighteneth thy esteem of Jesus Christ, and raiseth thy heart, and desires up to him, that it is the constant cry of thy soul to God, O give me Christ, or I dye, and am undone for ever; This is <hi>a good hearing,</hi> this is comfortable, and be of good chear, the Master calleth thee, <hi>Ho! every one that is athirst, come; And come all ye that are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and heavy laden.</hi> Are thy sins now a burthen to thee? But come to Christ, and he will ease thee.</p>
               <p>And though thou canst not say, I have made my
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:34554:134"/>
                  <hi>heart clean,</hi> I am pure from my sin; yet it is thine earnest suit unto God, that he would <hi>creat a clean heart</hi> within thee. And thou art so farre from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging and allowing of any lust, that thou criest out, <hi>O wretched man,</hi> or woman, when shall I be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! O that this thorn in the flesh were once <hi>pluckt out!</hi> Is there no member of the old man, that thou wouldest have spared? No, not the right eye, not the right hand?</p>
               <p>And though thou fallest short in thy obedience, yet thy will and desire is to <hi>follow God fully,</hi> and his commands are not grievous. Thou dost not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it a grievance, that God <hi>requires so much</hi> but this is the grief of thy soul, that thou dost no more. And how would it <hi>rejoyce thy heart,</hi> couldst thou serve him more, &amp; serve him better? well, thy unworthiness, thy wants, and weaknesses should not so much <hi>discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage thee,</hi> as the riches of Gods free grace in Christ ought to encourage thee. Is thy heart right with God? Then surely he <hi>will give thee his hand,</hi> his gracious helping hand; yea as thy heart is for God, and is now against sin, God will also <hi>be for thee,</hi> yea, his heart is towards every one, that offereth himself willingly. And so, as much as thou art wont to complain of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness, and weakness, yet surely thou mayest say, In the Lord have I righteouseness and strength; poor troubled heart, now encourage thy self in the Lord and in his gracious Covenant. This is all thy salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and here is all that thou canst desire, surely thou shalt be <hi>satisfied</hi> with favour, and full of the blessing of the Lord. To thee belongeth all the <hi>good and happiness</hi> included, and promised in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, of which thou mayest hear some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the next proposition.</p>

                  <hi>PROP. XIII.</hi> The benefits and blessings promised in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, and sure to all that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the aforementioned condition, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great and many, are indeed inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible, inestimable, and inconceivable.</head>
               <p>O That I could borrow the tongues of men and Angels for a while! what need of the tongue of the Learned here? yea, of that wine of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which would cause the lips of those that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep to speak? might one of us poor mortals have the priveledge (with him in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4.) to be caught up into Paradise, to hear how those blessed ones above set forth, and magnifie Covenant-blessings, continually praising and adoring that Free-grace of God in Christ, that brought them to a participation thereof, should we not hear <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, such lofty strains of heavenly Eloquence, as our low capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties would not be able to repeat after them?</p>
               <p>As when <hi>Jacob</hi> first heard of his son <hi>Joseph's</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and advancement in <hi>Egypt,</hi> his heart fainted: so it might be astonishing news to us, to hear what great things God hath promised, if we come up to Covenant-terms. As when the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> had
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:34554:135"/>seen the glory of King <hi>Solomon,</hi> there was no more spirit in her: how ravishing should it be to the souls of the faithful, to see and hear what glory God holds forth to them in the Covenant of Grace. Here are riches of glory on the vessels of mercy. O the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the glory of this mystery! unsearchable riches indeed. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.23. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.27. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.8.</p>
               <p>It is not to be thought, that any man on earth, much less that such a worm as I, should make a full discovery of all the Blessings, and glorious pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veledges contained in Gods gracious Covenant. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entred into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. As we cannot by searching find out God <hi>to perfection,</hi> (<hi>Job</hi> 11.7.) so neither can we fully know, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the happiness of those, who have a special interest in God. As one sayes, <q>we shall never see the Covenant of Grace fully <hi>unfolded,</hi> till (according to <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.12.) the Heavens come to be <hi>folded up;</hi>
                  </q> or rather till we see Heaven it self opened.</p>
               <p>The Grand promise here is <hi>[I will be their God]</hi> a promise containing all the rest. A promise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Him, whom the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain.</p>
               <p>Who is he that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, let him no more walk dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consolately; but encourage himself in the Lord <hi>his God.</hi> Well mayest thou rejoyce in thy portion. <hi>Deus meus, &amp; omnia.</hi> O rejoyce in his Highness for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But was not God the God of <hi>Ieshurun?</hi> as
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:34554:136"/>
                  <hi>Moses</hi> said, none like unto the <hi>God of Ieshurun.</hi> And yet <hi>Jeshurun</hi> forsook God, and lightly esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Rock of his Salvation. And when the Lord saw it, he abhorred them, because of the provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his sons, and of his daughters, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.15, 19. To the Israelites <hi>in common</hi> pertained the <hi>Adoption,</hi> and the glory, and the Covenants, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith. Yet with many of them God was not well pleased; but overthrew them in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness. Yea, sometimes he said of them, <hi>you only have I known of all the families of the earth: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will punish you for all your iniquities, Amos</hi> 3.2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Grant all this, yet it is no denial, or diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your happiness, who have a <hi>special propriety</hi> in God; nor should it be any damp to your joy, and rejoycing in Him.</p>
               <p>As there is a twofold call, so there is a twofold relation to God; as a twofold manner of being in Covenant with God, so a <hi>twofold interest</hi> in Him. Observe it, there is a common, external, and ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual; and again there is a special, internal, and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual call to God: So there is a more <hi>common</hi> Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God, and a more <hi>special</hi> Relation to Him. A Common intrest in God, and a Special intrest in him.</p>
               <p>Indeed a great priviledge it is to be a people <hi>near unto the Lord,</hi> to be so much as externally in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with Him. Yea, it is far better to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his House and Family, though under the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Rod, than to be driven out of his house and heritage, though it were with <hi>Babylon,</hi> to sit as Queen in the earth. Better to suffer affliction with the people of God, to enjoy his word and ordinances, the ordinary means of salvation; than
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:34554:136"/>to enjoy the largest share of worldly Pleasures, Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Prosperity, without them. Thus <hi>Englands</hi> Mercies (were the Land more Impoverished than it is, yet) are to be prized above the Treasures of both <hi>Indies.</hi> That was a desperate prophane speech of him, that said, <q>He would not change his part in <hi>Paris,</hi> for a part in Paradise.</q> The Barrenest part of <hi>Gods Hill,</hi> is to be chosen before the <hi>fatest Valleys,</hi> where God dwelleth not. So <hi>Lot</hi> found: Surely, they have cause to say, The Lines are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len to them in pleasant places, and they have a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Heritage, that dwell in <hi>Emmanuel's Land.</hi> Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are the People, that hear, and know the joyful sound: The Damned, with whom God will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley no more, count such happy. The <hi>Heathen,</hi> that are <hi>without God in the world,</hi> and strangers to the Tearms and Tenor of his Covenant, did they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand their own Estates, would count such hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. But as it is the Misery of those <hi>without,</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, not to know their Misery; so of too many <hi>within the Church,</hi> not to know, or consider their own happiness, what Advantages they have for Heaven above others. As our Saviour, weeping over that sinful City, that rejected him and his Grace; that chose rather to Die and Perish, than to be gathered under his healing Wings: [O, if <hi>Thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace,</hi> Luke 19.42.] If thou hadst known these things, then mightest thou have been for ever happy.</p>
               <p>But therefore thou that hast attended to the things of thy peace, and hast come in upon Gods Call, thou art happy: Now is Salvation come to thy soul. And if there be enough in God, in Christ,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:34554:137"/>in Heaven to make thee happy, thou shalt be for ever happy. Others have had Life and Salvation <hi>offered,</hi> but could not see to take it. But happy thou indeed, who hast (with <hi>Mary) chosen that good part,</hi> which shall never be taken from thee. To thee this everlasting Covenant (which I am opening) shall be a spring of Everlasting Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Now you may look upon God, as your God indeed. I say, <hi>God is yours.</hi> And though this be a <hi>short Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,</hi> soon utrered, yet is it so Copious a Subject, as you might be Meditating on all your days, and yet never be able fully to comprehend the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness included in it. When I say, <hi>God is yours,</hi> I have said all, I can say no more: For all Happiness is implied, and included in it.</p>
               <p>The misery of the Damned is comprized in two particulars, <hi>scil. In poenâ Damni,</hi> and <hi>In poenâ Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> in what good they have lost, and are deprived of for ever, and what evil they feel, have Inflicted on them, and must ever lie under. On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the happiness of the Faithful is sum'd up in these two Points, to wit, <hi>Freedom from Evil,</hi> and <hi>Frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Good.</hi> And how safe are they, who have God for their <hi>Shield?</hi> How Rich are they, who have God for their <hi>Portion,</hi> an All-sufficient God for their Reward? O exceeding great Reward! As holy <hi>David</hi> says here, <hi>This is all my Salvation, and all my desire:</hi> Or as some read it, <hi>He is all my Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and He is all my desire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">[1.] That now you have a special propriety in God, this is all your Salvation.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) It speaks you <hi>freed from the guilt of sin.</hi> So <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33, 34. Where the Lord promiseth to be
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:34554:137"/>their God, he addeth: <hi>[For I will forgive their Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and I will remember their sin no more.]</hi> Sin unpardoned separateth betwixt God and souls: Therefore God evermore forgiveth their Iniquities, unto whom he gives himself. Now what a blessed Priviledge is this, to have your sins pardoned! Even as <hi>David describeth Blessedness,</hi> Psal. 32.1. <hi>Blessed are they whose Iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.</hi> What would not a condemned Traitor, or Malefactor give for the Kings pardon? And what is a Pardon from God worth then, which could no other way be Purchased, but by the most precious Blood of his dear Son? But you who have felt what a burden sin is, and have sometimes cried out of that burden, as Intollerable; certainly, you cannot but account the pardon of sin a Mercy and Priviledge inestimable. O blessed change indeed, for one that was a Rebel, sentenced to Death by the Law of Heaven, to have the black Sentence rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and to become a Favourite of God: For a Child of Wrath to become a Child of Love. The pardon of sin carrieth <hi>Redemption</hi> in it, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.14. <hi>In whom we have Redemption (through his Blood) even the Forgiveness of sins.</hi> The pardon of sin connotes <hi>Justification,</hi> or is all one with it. The way of Justifying one that hath been a sinner, an Offender, being by the pardoning of all, wherein he hath offended. The pardon of sin speaketh peace, and <hi>Reconciliation</hi> with God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. God was in Christ Reconciling the World unto himself, not imputing their Trespasses unto them. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of sin inferreth <hi>Adoption, Gal.</hi> 4.5.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) It speaketh you <hi>delivered from the dominion
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:34554:138"/>of sin.</hi> Though your Corruptions will be a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance to you while in this Imperfect state, yet sin shall not have dominion over you: <hi>For ye are not under the Law, but under Grace,</hi> Rom. 6.14. You are not barely under a Law commanding, but under a <hi>gracious Covenant,</hi> which as it requireth Duty, so it encourageth with a promise of Grace, and help to perform it. The Lord hath promised, as to Forgive, so likewise to Subdue the Iniquities of his People, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.18, 19. Though there be some Life in the Members of the Old-man, as you feel to your sorrow; yet it is <hi>wounded at the heart,</hi> of which wound it shall never recover. So</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) It speaketh you safe from the <hi>final Preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency</hi> of Temptations. Your God is greater than all: Neither Men, nor Devils are able to pluck you out of your Fathers hand, <hi>John</hi> 10.29. Therefore the Gates of Hell shall not prevail. You are still liable to be tempted, yet being in firm League with God, you shall have seasonable succour from him. As <hi>Saul</hi> encouraged the men of <hi>Jabesh-Gilead,</hi> To morrow by that time the Sun is hot, ye shall have help. So God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. He will quench Satans fiery darts, before they shall have quite drunk up your spirits: Yea, the God of Peace shall bruise Satan under your Feet short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) It assureth of a seasonable Deliverance out of <hi>spiritual Troubles,</hi> so it may support one under present sad disertion. You have now shot the Gulph, you are passed from Death to Life. And though you may be full of Fears sometimes, and passing sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence against your selves; though your condition
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:34554:138"/>for the present may not be so comfortable, yet it is safe. You may sometimes walk in Darkness, yet the Lord will be your everlasting Light: Your days of Mourning shortly will be ended. The Lord will be a Sun as well as a Shield, to the Upright.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) It speaketh Exemption, or <hi>Deliverance from outward Troubles,</hi> when it may be good for you. God is known in <hi>Zions</hi> Palaces for a Refuge, God is in the midst of her▪ God shall help her, and that right early. And because thou hast made the Lord which is my Refuge, even the most High, thy Habitation: There shall no evil befal thee, <hi>Psal.</hi> 91.9, 10.</p>
               <p n="6">(6.) Or it speaketh Deliverance from the <hi>evil of Affliction.</hi> You may be Afflicted but not Forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, <hi>Psal.</hi> 89.32.33, 34. <hi>I will visit their iniquities with stripes. Nevertheless, my loving Kindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to fail.</hi> My Covenant will I not break, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the thing that is gone out of my Lips. Yea, as it is, <hi>Neh.</hi> 13.2. <hi>Our God turned the Curse into a Blessing.</hi> Your God will do as much for you, will turn Crosses into Blessings. No evil shall befal you, but what hath <hi>Rationem boni,</hi> what God will turn to good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. As it is, <hi>Ezra</hi> 8.22. <hi>The hand of our God is upon all them for good, that seek him.</hi> Yea, even his Afflicting hand too: His <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting hand</hi> is never on them, but for good. So I may allude to that Passage, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.4, 5. When <hi>Samuel</hi> came to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> the Elders trembled at his coming, and said, <hi>Comest thou peaceably?</hi> And he said, <hi>Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the Lord: sanctifie your selves, and come with me to the sacrifice.</hi> So indeed you may be set on trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:34554:139"/>when Sickness comes, when Poverty comes, when such an Affliction comes you may fall a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling; whereas, if you stay and enquire about the <hi>end of its coming,</hi> you may be satisfied, that it <hi>comes peaceably.</hi> It is not the Wound of an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, nor the Chastisement of a Cruel one: But a Call from God, your Father, to <hi>sanctifie your selves,</hi> and offer up some Lust, some sin, or other, a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. It may be Sickness comes as a Cure of thy spiritual Indisposition, security, and Deadness; it may be crosses in Estate come, to cause thee to offer up thy Pride, Luxury, Sensuality, Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. As when <hi>David</hi> would know of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> whether they came indeed to help, or to betray him: They answered (1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.17, 18.) <hi>Thine are we,</hi> David, <hi>and on thy side: Peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to thine hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; for thy God helpeth thee.</hi> O the happy estate of those that are at peace with God! He will cause the very stones of the Field, and the Beasts of the Field, and what was most likely to offend, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy them, to be at peace with them. Great peace have such indeed, nothing shall offend them. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions come not to harm, but to help them. As they said, We are thine, <hi>David;</hi> so if God be yours, then all things are yours. All changes that come, are on your side, your helpers.</p>
               <p n="7">(7.) It speaketh your <hi>security from final Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> and so from final <hi>Condemnation.</hi> Now your condition is safe indeed, safe to Eternity. Though you may not therefore give way to <hi>sinful Security,</hi> which is opposite to an holy fear, and cautiousness. No, but therefore your estate is safe, because God hath promised to <hi>keep you in his fear,</hi> Jer. 32.40. <hi>I
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:34554:139"/>will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.</hi> And they that have his Grace, not to depart from him here, shall not be sentenced to depart from him hereafter. You that are brought in, and kept close to God here, shall not be banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, separated from God hereafter: You whom God Justifieth here. he will not condemn hereafter. The Lord knoweth them that are his, and will own, and openly acknowledge them before the whole world at the last day.</p>
               <p>Thus you that come up to Covenant Terms, and so have the Lord for your God, you are <hi>delivered from</hi> the greatest evils; and <hi>delivered by</hi> lesser evils, that come upon you. I say, by lesser evils, God delivereth you from greater, who will deliver you from all evils at last. Thus God is your Shield, and all others are but as Paper-shields, or Painted-shields, compared with the Shield of thine help. <hi>Salvation is of the Lord.</hi> All Salvation; if God be for us, who, or what can be against us? No such Guard against evil in all the world, as God, the chiefest Good. See here the safety of those, who are in firm League with the Almighty, under the special protection of God most High. See the wonderful Immunities of such, as have him for their Protector and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour: Well might <hi>David</hi> say of it, <hi>This is all my Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">[2.] Yea, further in this special propriety in God, there is included <hi>all Good,</hi> that a gracious soul <hi>can desire,</hi> Psal. 73.25. <hi>Whom have I in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee.</hi> You that have the Lord for your God indeed, how can you desire more, than God hath promised to be unto you, and to do for you? You
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:34554:140"/>have all, in having him, who hath all things, and can do all things.</p>
               <p>Not that you are <hi>Godded with God,</hi> as some have spoken blasphemously. But remember ye what followed the Ambition of our first Parents, their affecting to be as Gods, sacrilegious Ambition. Thus the Devil lifted them up by his Temptation, that he might bring them down, to be like himself. Such <hi>Heaven-daring pride</hi> as that, must needs have a fall. As <hi>Tyrus</hi> is threatned, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28.2.6.8. <hi>Because thine heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am God, Because thou hast set thine heart as the Heart of God: They shall bring thee down to the Pit, and thou shalt die the death.</hi> Such <hi>high-flown spirits,</hi> as talk of the <hi>fulness of the God-head dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling bodily in the Saints,</hi> are not the Children of Light, but the Children of Pride, <hi>Erratick stars,</hi> to whom (without a self-abasing sight of themselves) is reserved the blackness of Darkness for ever.</p>
               <p>It's true, God gives himself to his People, to be enjoyed, and glorified of them; but not so, as to be Debased, and Degraded in them, to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Creatures, nor so as to Exalt, and Raise them above the condition of Creatures. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates <hi>his Mercy</hi> freely, but <hi>his Glory</hi> he will not give to another. As <hi>Pharaoh</hi> heaped Dignities, and Royal Favours upon <hi>Joseph:</hi> Only (said he) in the Throne will I be greater than thou. God will do wonderful things for his People: But as for those that talk of their being <hi>Godded with God,</hi> they would un-God him; and deifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>But I come to you, who have a special Interest in God.</p>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:34554:140"/>
               <p n="1">(1.) God is yours in the sweetest <hi>Relations.</hi> God is your <hi>Shepherd.</hi> And what doth the Psalmist in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from thence? <hi>The Lord is my Shepherd, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall not want,</hi> Psal. 23.1. God is your <hi>Teacher,</hi> John 6.45. And there is none that Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, like him. God is your <hi>Father,</hi> as Christ said, <hi>John</hi> 20.17. <hi>I ascend unto my Father, and your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to my God, and your God.</hi> If your God, then your Father. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.18. <hi>I will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my Sons and Daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.</hi> And what a priviledge is this, to have God for your Father, and to be own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as his Children. The Children of God can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be <hi>left Orphans.</hi> The Sons of God can never want an Inheritance. Surely, Heaven is enough for all Gods Children. In our Fathers House there is Bread enough, and there is Room enough, <hi>John</hi> 14.2. God is your <hi>Husband,</hi> Hos. 2.16, 19. O happy Match for thee, to have thy Maker for thy Husband. He is a <hi>meet help</hi> indeed. An All-suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient God <hi>is</hi> a <hi>meet help</hi> indeed for poor Indigent Creatures; only we are infinitely unworthy of him, not meet for him of our selves. 'Tis his Infinite Free-grace that accounts, and makes us meet.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) All Gods <hi>Attributes</hi> are yours. There is no Attribute, or Property of his, but may speak Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour unto, and will set against all those, that are, and keep at a distance from him. Even the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God, which such have abused, will plead, and witness against them; the Grace and Mercy of God, which they have slighted, and rejected, will rise up in Judgment against them one day. On the contrary, there is no Attribute of Gods, but speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:34554:141"/>good to them that are at peace with God. O what a <hi>rich Store-house</hi> of Comfort is here, to have all Gods glorious Attributes engaged, and at work for you! His absolute Soveraignty, and infinite Power engaged, and at work to uphold, protect, and defend you. His perfect Wisdom, and Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niscience, to see to you, and to order all things for the best, that concern you. His tender and never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>failing Compassion, to pity you. His rich Mercy, and boundless Love, to relieve you. His constant Truth, and everlasting Faithfulness, to perform all the good promises that he hath made unto you. His Holiness to Transform you into the same Image, to Assimulate you. His Justice, to avenge you of your Enemies, to execute Judgment for you. His Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipresence, graciously to accompany you. His Unchangeableness, and Eternity, to continue his loving Kindness to you, and to Crown all he does for you in endless Happiness.</p>
               <p>As when the Spouse had given a Lively, Lofty, and Lovely Description of her Beloved, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.10. <hi>&amp;c. My Beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among Ten Thousand.</hi> His Head as the most fine Gold, his Eyes as of Doves. His Cheeks, as a Bed of Spices. His Lips like Lillies, dropping sweet smelling Myrrhe. His Legs as Pillars of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, set in Sockets of Gold. His Countenance as <hi>Lebanon,</hi> excellent as the Cedars. His Mouth most sweet; yea, he is altogether Lovely. Then she concludes thus exulting, and making her boast of him, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>This is my Beloved, and this is my Friend.</hi> So you who have now given up your selves to be the Lords, after the <hi>largest survey</hi> of the Divine perfections, you can possibly take, you
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:34554:141"/>may sit down, and rest in this sweet close, <hi>This God is our God;</hi> and he will be our Guide even unto Death, yea, unto Glory. This Almighty, All-commanding, All-wise, All-knowing God, this Immense Being, this Holy, Just, Loving, Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and Merciful God; this Faithful, Unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, Eternal God, is our God for ever and ever. This, this is the Heritage of the Servants of the Lord, and their Righteousness is of me, saith the Lord: So likewise their Bliss, and Happiness.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) If God be yours, his <hi>Christ is</hi> yours. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is in, and through Christ, that God is yours.</p>
               <p>Though they speak not the words of Truth, and Soberness, but like men forsaken of God, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son too; like men given up to strong Delusions, who talk of their being <hi>Christed with Christ.</hi> And that is a weak, and frivolous Objection, (which might seem to befriend them) <hi>scil.</hi> If Christ and his Righteousness be made over to Believers, then they should be <hi>Mediators,</hi> Saviours, as Christ is. It follows not. As the Husband giveth himself in Marriage to the Wife, but that maketh not the Wife an Head, or Husband. Christ and his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is <hi>made over</hi> to us, <hi>to a certain end,</hi> that is, to our Justification, and Salvation, not to make us Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours: He is made unto us <hi>Redemption,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. but we are never said to be made <hi>Redeemers</hi> by him. <hi>Aliud est justitia Christi Mediatoria quoad officium: aliud est justitia Christi Mediatoris quoad Meritum.</hi> As Dr. <hi>Arrowsmith.</hi> Or it is for the sake of Christ, with respect to his Righteousness, and Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that we sinners come to be Pardoned, Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; not that we are as perfect, as Christ himself:
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:34554:142"/>But being interested in him, we have his Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on interposing betwixt us and Gods Justice, and procuring Pardon for us.</p>
               <p>Now blessed art thou above Millions of Men, and Women, who mayst say, <hi>Christ is mine.</hi> Yea, this is Inconceivably more, than if all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the world were thine. He is the Pearl of greatest price. All things in the world, but Loss, and Dung, compared to this Pearl. O the precious Blood, and precious Benefits of Christ! O the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable Riches of Christ!</hi> O the Fulness of Christ! In him <hi>all fulness</hi> dwells. There is an Infinite ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness both of Merit, and Grace in him.</p>
               <p>He is and hath all that souls stand in need or can desire, to make them happy. He is the great <hi>Lord Treasurer</hi> of Heaven. And, O the Treasures of Wisdom, Righteousness, and Strength, that are with him! <hi>Ho, every one that thirsteth come,</hi> Isa. 55.1. <hi>Whosoever will, let him take of the Water of Life freely,</hi> Rev. 22.17. There is enough in Christ to fill, and satisfie all the thirsty souls in the world; enough in Christ for every one that will come, be they never so many. <hi>One Christ</hi> is enough for all the Faithful: Yea, <hi>Christ alone</hi> is enough for them. For whom I have suffered the loss of all things (says the Apostle) and do count them <hi>but dung</hi> that I may win Christ, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. All things were accounted nothing in comparison of Christ; better want all things than want Christ. He is All in all, yea, he is All even out of all. Though you should have nothing here, yet enjoying Christ, you may be happier, than if you <hi>possessed all things</hi> in the world. He is the <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred-fold Father,</hi> and Mother; as Mr. <hi>Vines</hi> used to say. He is the Hundred-fold House and Land,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:34554:142"/>the <hi>Hundred-fold Estate</hi> spoken of, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.29, 30. And you would not count him a poor man, that had put <hi>off his Lumber</hi> and Trash, and turned his Estate into Gold and Jewels, things of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est value.</p>
               <p>Hast thou a Christ? why then thou hast the <hi>Heir of all things,</hi> even him, who will be all things to thee, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. He is made unto us Wisdom, and Righteousness, and Sanctification, and Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. If Christ be ours he will be <hi>our Prophet,</hi> to Instruct us, our Priest to Expiate our sins, and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie us; our King to Redeem and Save us.</p>
               <p>Thou that hast Christ, thou hast the <hi>true Light:</hi> and he shall give thee Light, when others still abide in darkness.</p>
               <p>Thou hast the <hi>Sun of Righteousness</hi> risen on thee, while others are under the power of the Prince of darkness. O the glorious Apparel of the meanest Saints clothed with the Sun! Every true Believer shines in the <hi>Beams</hi> of this Sun of Righteousness, and is far more richly arayed therewith, than <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> was in his Cloath of Silver, glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Sun.

               </p>
               <p>Thou that hast Christ, thou hast the <hi>true Bread</hi> that came down from Heaven. The Bread of Life, while they that are strangers to Christ, feed upon <hi>ashes,</hi> feed upon Husks, things which can never satisfie. Thou that hast Christ, thou hast the <hi>Well of Life:</hi> Thou mayst drink freely of the Water of Life, while others (alas) have only broken Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterns, and stinking Puddles to go too.</p>
               <p>What a full Christ is this? Our Light, and our Righteousness, and our Peace, and our Life; in a word, our All.</p>

               <p n="4">(4.) If God be yours, then <hi>his Spirit</hi> is yours. Indeed some speak of the Person of the Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given to, and the <hi>Person of the Holy Ghost</hi> dwelling in the Faithful; which yet they thus Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <q>You must not conceive that thereby he doth make us one Person, with himself, or that he doth Communicate unto us any Personal, or Divine property of his own (for that is <hi>Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable</hi>) <hi>Lyford senses exterr. p.</hi> 141.</q> Now such as go this way must not be ranked in our thoughts with those I speak of before, men of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt minds, and profligate principles.</p>
               <p>Though I confess I have some doubt, whether the Expression of the <hi>Spirits personal In-dwelling</hi> in the Godly, be safe, as they lay it down. For ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it would seem, not to hold forth enough, <hi>scil.</hi> To import no more than that he is <hi>essentially present</hi> in them, and so he is every where present, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139.7. <hi>Whither shall I go from thy Spirit, or whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall I flee from thy presence.</hi> Thus the wicked have his presence, what ever they are doing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they are: Or else it would seem to import too much, <hi>scil.</hi> a <hi>personal Ʋnion</hi> of the Holy Ghost, and Believers, which all that are sober must deny. Otherwise they must hold the <hi>Spirit Incarnate,</hi> as well as the Son, and that the Spirit and a Believer, make but one Person; and so (as Christ the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> was the Son of God, the Humane Nature being taken into the Person of the Son of God) eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Believer should be the Holy Ghost. Again, we read as well of God the Father, and Christs dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Faithful, and making their abode with them. And what reason there is to imagine some <hi>peculiar way</hi> of the Spirits In-dwelling different
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:34554:143"/>from that of the Father, and the Son, I am not able to apprehend.</p>
               <p>But you that have given up your selves to God, How is his Mercy magnified towards you? They are not <hi>mean things</hi> that he gives to you; No, he gives you Himself, he gives you his Son, he gives you his Spirit. O thrice happy Creatures! who have a <hi>special Interest</hi> in God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. O unspeakable Gift! O infinite Gift! As when God made promise to <hi>Abraham,</hi> because he could swear by <hi>no greater,</hi> he swore by Himself. So, when he promiseth himself, his Son and Spirit, we must say he could promise <hi>nothing greater.</hi> As <hi>Araunah</hi> gave like a King; what God giveth to his people is <hi>like a God:</hi> as Christ is called the gift of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.20. Certainly God could give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more like himself, (<hi>John</hi> 10.30. <hi>John</hi> 5.7.)</p>
               <p>As Christ said, Whether is greater the Gold or the Temple that sanctifieth the Gold? Whether is greater, the Gift, or the Altar that sanctifieth the Gift? The <hi>holy Spirit</hi> is such a Gift as sanctifieth all other Gifts; and so of all Gifts the greatest. The Evangelist <hi>Luke,</hi> for <hi>[good things]</hi> inserts <hi>[the holy Spirit,]</hi> in Mat. 7.11. <hi>How much more shall your Heavenly Father give [good things] to them that ask him.</hi> Which is thus, Luke 11.13. <hi>How much more shall your Heavenly Father give [the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit] to them that ask him.</hi> Gods giving the holy Spirit to any, is the giving of all good Things, <hi>in Pignore.</hi> His giving the Spirit is an Earnest and Pledge of more, that he intendeth to give. It is a <hi>leading Blessing,</hi> that comes to make way for more. It is given to prepare you for <hi>Mercy,</hi> to prepare you for <hi>Glory.</hi> Think of those sweet and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

               <p>He is the <hi>Spirit of Truth,</hi> and so he will lead you into all necessary Truth, <hi>John</hi> 16.13. He is the <hi>best Teacher,</hi> 1 John 2.27. <hi>Ye need not that any man teach you, but as the same anointing teacheth you.</hi> O! there is none teacheth <hi>like</hi> him. He is the best Guide. Men may be deceived, and may deceive others, may mistake and mislead others; so cannot the <hi>Spirit of Truth,</hi> you that are Lead by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, you have a good Guide indeed, a faithful guide, that will not suffer you to Erre damnably, will not suffer you finally to miscarry; he is the Spirit of Wisdom, the best Counsellor.</p>
               <p>He is the <hi>Spirit of Grace,</hi> Heb. 10.29. And Love, Joy, Peace, Long-suffering, Gentleness, Goodness, Faith, Meekness, Temperance, are the Fruit of the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22, 23. And what are the most precious <hi>Fruits of the Earth,</hi> to the Fruits of the Spirit? Now let not the Eunuch that hath joyned himself to the Lord, say, Behold, I am a <hi>dry Tree.</hi> Instead of the <hi>Bryer,</hi> shall come up the <hi>Mirtle-tree.</hi> Of a dry Tree the Spirit of Grace, can make a fruitful Bough; like <hi>Joseph,</hi> can make a <hi>Tree of Righteousness,</hi> full of good and pleasant Fruits. His presence is enough to turn a Desert into an <hi>Eden,</hi> a Wilderness into the Garden of God.</p>
               <p>He is the <hi>Spirit of Power,</hi> that though we are weak indeed, yet we may be strengthened in the Inner man by the Spirit, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.16. May be enabled to tread down strength, to mortifie our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, <hi>through the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8.13. Thus we are enabled to discharge Duties, the <hi>Spirit help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                  <pb n="279" facs="tcp:34554:144"/>our Infirmities, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. Thus we are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to walk in Gods wayes, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. <hi>I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my Statutes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He is the <hi>Spirit of Life:</hi> The Quickning <hi>Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8.11. Can these dry Bones live? Yea, if the Spirit of Life enter into them. <hi>David</hi> oft pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for <hi>quickening.</hi> Such as are alive in a spiritual sence, should desire and pray to be more <hi>lively.</hi> Well, it is the Spirit that quickeneth, as it was with the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel, Ezek.</hi> 3.24. <hi>The Spirit enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon me, and set me upon my feet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He is the <hi>Spirit of Liberty.</hi> The Free-spirit, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.11. Uphold me with thy free Spirit, where the Spirit of the Lord is there is <hi>Liberty,</hi> we are oft <hi>streightned,</hi> alas: But it is because we are a-want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our selves, and because we do not entertain the Spirit of his <hi>good likeing,</hi> cherish his Motions, follow his Councels; we are streightned in our selves, but the Spirit of the Lord is not streightned.</p>
               <p>He is the <hi>Spirit of Glory,</hi> the Comforter. And you that carefully attend to his quickening Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels shall in the end attain to his chearing Comforts. And what is the Joy of Harvest, to that Joy in the Holy Ghost? VVhat is the Joy of them that divide the spoil, to the Joy of Gods salvation? As we read of the Spirits helping Believers in Prayer with <hi>groans unutterable,</hi> Rom. 8.26. So will he in due time furnish them as well for the work of Praising God, filling them with <hi>Joy unspeakable,</hi> and full of Glory, see <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.15.</p>
               <p>And such (as you have heard) is that good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, which is given unto all those, who tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>give up</hi> themselves to God. O blessed souls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed!
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:34554:145"/>O thrice happy Creatures! To whom God gives Himself, his Son, and <hi>Spirit,</hi> Rejoyce in the Lord ye Righteous, and again, and again, I say rejoyce. Let not the Consolation of God seem small to you. If there be any <hi>Consolation</hi> in the God of all Consolation, if any Consolation in Christ, if any Comfort to be had in the Spirit, the <hi>Comforter,</hi> it is for you. Gladness it is for the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in heart. What more can be wished to make you happy, than is included in the Apostles <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> or Benediction, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.14. <hi>The Grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Love of God, and the Communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all.</hi> Now these are all <hi>with you</hi> indeed, and shall be ever with you. As Crist promised, <hi>John</hi> 14.16, 17. The Spirit of Truth, the Comforter, shall dwell and abide <hi>with you</hi> for ever. O happy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that have the good Spirit of God your Guide, and Counsellor, your Companion, and Comforter; The <hi>Spirit of Truth</hi> to teach you, the Spirit of Grace to sanctifie you, the Spirit of Power to <hi>assist</hi> and help you; the Spirit of Life to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en; the Spirit of Liberty to enlarge you; the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Joy and Peace to <hi>revive</hi> and comfort you; the Spirit of Glory to rest upon you. Though earthly Friends may fail, may forsake you; yet here is a Friend indeed, that will stick to you, and abide with you for ever.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) The good <hi>Providence</hi> of God is still at work for you. <hi>My Father worketh hitherto, and I work,</hi> says Christ, <hi>John</hi> 5.17. Gods attributes are still at work for you. <hi>His Eyes</hi> at work. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Eyes of the Lord is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his Mercy. The Eyes
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:34554:145"/>of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole Earth, to watch over those, whose hearts are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right towards him, His <hi>Hands</hi> are at work: The good Hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him; yea, many times his <hi>Arm</hi> is made bare, his Arm is stretched out. That the Heathen, and their Enemies are forced to acknowledge, The Lord <hi>hath done great things</hi> for them▪ It shall be said of <hi>Israel, What hath God wrought?</hi> Who raised up the Righteous man from the <hi>East?</hi> O how great is his goodness, which he hath <hi>laid up</hi> for them that fear him, and which he is also <hi>laying out</hi> on them, which he hath wrought for them before the sons of men!</p>
               <p>The Providence of God is two-fold, there is a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> Providence, and a special Providence.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Common Providence</hi> over the Creatures in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, as they are Gods Creatures. A <hi>Special Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> over the Faithful, as in nearer Relation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, his Children, his Friends, and Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates. As God hath a <hi>Special propriety</hi> in them, so he hath a special care of them.</p>
               <p>We read he preserveth Man and Beast, <hi>Psal.</hi> 36.6. But more <hi>especially</hi> that he preserveth the Faithful, <hi>Psal.</hi> 31.23. He is the Saviour of all men, but <hi>espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially</hi> of them that Believe.</p>
               <p>Yet even the Common Providence of God is a special ground of Encouragement to his People, That he is the <hi>Preserver</hi> of all things. If he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videth for the young Lyons, and the Ravens that cry; much more that he will provide for the Sheep of his Pasture, and for his Lambs; while he Feeds his Enemies, he will not let his own Children starve.</p>
               <p>Again, That he Governeth all things, without whom no man can lift up Hand or Foot in all the
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:34554:146"/>world, without whom not a Dog that can move his Tongue. He that ruleth in <hi>Jacob,</hi> over-ruleth all to the ends of the Earth.</p>
               <p>But come we to his <hi>Special Providence</hi> over the Faithful. So, <hi>all the Paths of the Lord are Mercy and Truth unto such as keep his Covenant,</hi> Psal. 25.10. By the <hi>Paths of the Lord,</hi> there we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, not the Paths <hi>of his Precepts,</hi> wherein he would have us to walk, but the paths of his <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> wherein he walks towards his people: The way of his proceedings.</p>
               <p>And what is said of these paths? They are all <hi>[Mercy and Truth]</hi> which some make an <hi>Hendig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> like that Jer. 22.3. <hi>Execut Iudgment and Righteousness;</hi> that is, Execute righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So here Mercy and Truth, <hi>i. e. Mercy</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. Or we may take them as distinct, as hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth thus much, that God doth not only <hi>begin</hi> with them in a way of mercy, but <hi>goes on</hi> with them as he had begun. His mercy to such is constant. He continues his loving Kindness to these, even <hi>of his truth</hi> and Faithfulness; or thus, Truth hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to some word that God hath spoken: Not to the <hi>word of threatning</hi> here, because Mercy is joyned with it: What can it refer to therefore, but the word <hi>of Promise?</hi> signifying Gods performing promise, keeping Covenant with such as keep Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him? So the meaning is, in <hi>all the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages</hi> of Divine providence God is still intending good, and extending Mercy, and performing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to his people.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Patience</hi> may be exercised towards others; but his special Grace and Favour, his loving Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and tender Mercy is drawn out towards you.</p>
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:34554:146"/>
               <p>God may shew <hi>some Mercy</hi> to wicked men, in some of his ways. But alas, their Mercies are not <hi>pure Mercies,</hi> No, there is wrath also mixed with their Mercies. As the murmuring <hi>Israelites</hi> had Quails and a Curse. But you have <hi>real Mercies,</hi> a blessing with Estate, a blessing with Health, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Gods special Love with Common Mercies, greatly Enhaunsing and Raising <hi>the Value</hi> of them. They come not as <hi>Wind-falls</hi> of common Providence (as <hi>one expresseth it</hi>) but are sound Fruits, growing on the Promise. So there is Mercy <hi>in all</hi> Gods Paths towards you. You shall meet with it at every turn, Mercy shall prevent you, and follow you, and compass you about. Yea, in the end you shall <hi>find Mercy</hi> in the crossest Paths of Providence, wherein at present you may apprehend nothing but <hi>Severity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, whatsoever Mercy God sheweth to sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, yet they have no assurance thereof. How soon may Gods <hi>Patience</hi> be turned into Fury, and his Goodness into Severity? But God hath promised that he will not turn away from you, (<hi>Ier.</hi> 32.40.) to do you good. But you who have a care to walk before God in <hi>sincerity</hi> and <hi>truth,</hi> you shall find all his ways Mercy and Truth. And this leads me to another Priviledge of yours.</p>
               <p n="6">(6.) The <hi>Promises</hi> are yours, exceeding great and precious Promises. You are the Children, and Heirs of <hi>the Promise.</hi> Promises are held forth to others; but they are also made <hi>over to</hi> you. To the <hi>Jews</hi> in some sence pertained the Covenants, and the Promises, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. God had written those <hi>great things</hi> to them, and offered those great things to them, yet they not looking after the Condition
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:34554:147"/>required of them, it was <hi>in effect</hi> as if God had made no such promise. But you that can plead the <hi>Condition</hi> is <hi>performed,</hi> nothing can bar your right to the Promise? God will never plead a <hi>[Non est factum]</hi> against those who may plead the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is performed. As the Lord said to <hi>Abraham</hi> concerning the Land of Promise, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. <hi>Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art, Northward, and Southward, and Eastward, and Westward: For all the Land which thou seest, to thee will I give it.</hi> So I may say to you concerning the <hi>word of the Kingdom</hi> (as the Gospel is called, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.19.) The word of Promise, look it through from the beginning to the end, <hi>search this good land</hi> that floweth with Milk and Honey, a Land of Brooks of Waters, of Fountains, of Depths, that spring out of the <hi>Rock Christ;</hi> where are both the Upper Springs, and the Neather Springs, Promises concerning this Life, and the Life to come; a Land of Vines, and Fig-trees, and Pomgranates; <hi>Dig into its Mines</hi> full of hid Treasure, more precious than Gold that perisheth, all is your own. The whole Land is before you, this <hi>Goshen,</hi> this Paradise, is given you, till you come to be Translated to the Heavenly <hi>Canaan.</hi> Your <hi>Joseph</hi> sends you these pleasant, and precious Fruits, to revive and chear your spirits, till you come to a <hi>fulness of joy</hi> in his presence, come to the sight and Fruition of Christ in Glory. <hi>Look up to Heaven,</hi> are you able to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Stars of Heaven? Neither can you take the just sum of what the Lord hath promised you; They are called <hi>the deep things of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.10. Here are deep Mines, deep Mysteries, who shall lead us into <hi>these hid treasures,</hi> unknown to the VVorld?
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:34554:147"/>What need of the Spirit of Wisdom and Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to enlighten our minds, that <hi>we may know</hi> what is the Hope of his Calling, and what the Riches of his glorious Grace?</p>
               <p>O precious Promises indeed! promises of <hi>more Grace.</hi> To him that hath more shall be given, and he shall have in abundance, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.29. God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth more Grace to the humble, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.6. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of perseverance in Grace, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. <hi>John</hi> 4.14.</p>
               <p>Again, there are Promises <hi>made to Grace,</hi> of which I could easily recite many: But after one hath used his utmost skill to open these Treasures, and to give you an Account, how much is contained in them, he must end with [an <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] After all, he must acknowledge there is much more behind undiscovered, like that Path (<hi>Job</hi> 28.7.) which the <hi>Vultures</hi> eye hath not seen, as may allude to the Expression. It is quite beyond our <hi>Arithmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> to find out the Total of the Divine Promises. So its impossible that any true Believer should know <hi>how rich</hi> he is in the Promises. O! the Promises are a long Field indeed, and much <hi>hid Treasure</hi> in this Field; yea, an unknown Treasure.</p>
               <p n="7">(7.) Gods <hi>Ordinances</hi> are yours, <hi>especially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi> for you, and blessed unto you. Ministers are yours, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Whether</hi> Paul <hi>or</hi> Apollo, <hi>or</hi> Cephas, <hi>all are yours, given to the Church, for the perfecting of the Saints,</hi> Ephes. 4.11, 12. To be helpers of your Faith and Joy. Ministers are Gods <hi>Stewards</hi> appointed to give you Meat in due season. Gods Servants to conduct you into the <hi>Presence Chamber</hi> of the great King. Ordinances they are the Chariots your <hi>Joseph</hi> sends to bring your souls nearer to him.</p>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:34554:148"/>
               <p>And O how amiable are his Tabernacles! O the pleasures of his House! O the <hi>sights</hi> of God, that you have sometimes in his Ordinances! Sights of his Power, <hi>sights</hi> of his glorious Grace. Have you not seen his Goodness pass before you? Have not his <hi>Footsteps</hi> dropped Fatness into your Souls? How oft that coming from the Word, or from Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, you might have said as they, <hi>Luke</hi> 5.26. <hi>We have seen strange things to day.</hi> God manifesting himself to your souls, so as he does not to the World. All <hi>the Paths</hi> of the Lord are Mercy to his People, as we heard before, but in the Paths of his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, in the <hi>Walks</hi> of his Courtes, there they are wont to find his choisest Mercies: There espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Lord commandeth the <hi>blessing.</hi> Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed they are in the House, and in the Field, but more blessed in Gods House, more blessed in his holy <hi>Mountain.</hi> There is an Expression, <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.21. <hi>[As the days of Heaven upon the Earth,]</hi> i. e. (Quamdiu mundus durabit,) which I only allude to here. The days we spend with God in his Courts, are <hi>as the days of Heaven upon Earth. Blessed are they that dwell in thy House, they will be still praising thee, a day in thy Courts is better than a thousand</hi> else-where, <hi>Psal.</hi> 84. To enjoy God here, this is <hi>Heaven upon Earth.</hi> Is not this the <hi>Mount</hi> of <hi>Transfiguration?</hi> The Gate of Heaven? The Mount of Blessing? Is it not good to be here?</p>
               <p>Well, you that have a special Interest in God, have a <hi>special right</hi> to the Ordinances of God; and may expect a <hi>special blessing</hi> on them, may look to enjoy God in them: Or if the Lord should see good to <hi>cut you short</hi> of Sanctuary-priviledges; yet you
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:34554:148"/>should still enjoy the God of Ordinances, he would be a <hi>little Sanctuary</hi> to you.</p>
               <p n="8">(8.) Gods <hi>Creatures</hi> are yours. As <hi>Jehoshaphat, [My People are as thy People, and my Horses as thy Horses.]</hi> When God is for you, what Creature of his can be against you?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Angels</hi> the best and noblest Creatures, are <hi>your Friends,</hi> Heb. 1.14. And full little do you think how many wayes they do Befriend you, how many ways they are <hi>Ministring,</hi> and helpful to you: True, there is no ground for the Invocating of Angels; but there is ground enough, why you should give thanks to God, for the Angels Ministring unto you.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Devils</hi> and wicked men (the worst of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) are your <hi>servants.</hi> Though it be quite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides their intention, sore against their will and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination. Though they intend evil against you, God will turn it to good.</p>
               <p>So likewise other Creatures. The World is yours, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22. The World is an <hi>appurtenance</hi> of your <hi>Inheritance,</hi> of that Estate which God by Covenant, and <hi>Deed of Gift</hi> hath settled on you, and confirmed to you. If Inferiour Creatures had a <hi>Tongue</hi> to speak, would they not say as <hi>Hushai, Whom the Lord shall chuse, his will I be?</hi> Or as the men of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and <hi>Judah, We are thine</hi> David, <hi>we are on thy side.</hi> It is a burden and bondage to the Creatures, to serve those who are Enemies to their Maker. The <hi>Earth groaneth</hi> under such, and if God would but give the word, it would imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately open her Mouth, and swallow them up.</p>
               <p>I do not deny but wicked men have <hi>a right</hi> to their Estates, and to the use of the Creatures. But the People of God have a better right than they.</p>
               <pb n="288" facs="tcp:34554:149"/>
               <p>That is certainly a mistake of some, that think all wicked men <hi>Ʋsurpers</hi> of the things they injoy. <q>If they have a right before God: I ask (sayes one) <hi>by what Covenant.</hi> Is it by the Covenant of Works? Then they must fulfil it? Is it by the Covenant of Grace? But they are not within it, cannot claim by it.</q>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is true, they ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil neither Covenant, and therefore have not a <hi>right by Covenant.</hi> But their Enumeration here is not full enough: <hi>Dater tertium.</hi> These things may be <hi>passed over,</hi> and men may have a right to them, and not by Covenant, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. <hi>I have given Mount</hi> Seir <hi>unto</hi> Esau <hi>for a possession,</hi> ver. 9. <hi>I have given</hi> Ar <hi>unto the Children of</hi> Lot <hi>for a possession,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Indentures drawn betwixt God and them. By <hi>his Providence</hi> he determineth the Bounds of mens Habitations. He that giveth unto all men Life and Breath, giveth them <hi>Food and Raiment.</hi> Though wicked men shall be called to account for their Mercies, yet not as Thieves, or <hi>Ʋsurpers;</hi> but as ill-users or <hi>abusers</hi> of them, as unfaithful Stewards.</p>
               <p>Wicked men therefore have a right to their Creature-comforts; but not so <hi>good a right</hi> as you. They have [a right by <hi>actual Collation, De presenti.</hi> (As Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> somewhere) but not by promise, <hi>De futuro.</hi>] They have a right by common provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, you <hi>by Covenant,</hi> and Compact. They have a right as Servants to their daily Bread, you have the right of Sons. Not indeed that any <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve</hi> the least Mercy at Gods Hand, as the Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Servant is worthy of his Meat; but a Servant may take his <hi>Masters allowance,</hi> and hath a right to the Clothes his Master gives him; only he hath
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:34554:149"/>no <hi>assurance</hi> of being provided for by his Master still. <hi>The servant abideth not in the House for ever, but the Son abideth ever,</hi> John 8.35.</p>
               <p>You that are earthly Parents, know how to give <hi>good things</hi> to your Children: And much more does your Heavenly Father, and he hath enough to give, <hi>The earth is the Lords, and the fulness thereof.</hi> Says the Father, Be a good Child, and while I have any thing, thou shalt not want. And so says God to you, You that fear me you shall never want any good thing; your Heavenly Father knoweth what is <hi>good for you,</hi> and hath promised, you shall never want, what is good for you. And how can you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire more? What? Would you have <hi>more than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough?</hi> when enough is more than all? <hi>Dimidium plus toto.</hi> Would you have more than is good? That were to wish evil to your selves.</p>
               <p n="9">(9.) <hi>Heaven is</hi> yours, if God be yours, his Kingdom your everlasting Home, and Inheritance, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.32. As he said, Son, thou art ever with me and <hi>all that I have is thine:</hi> So, if the Children of God, then Heirs of God; then you shall be ever with him, ever with the Lord, <hi>and Inherit that everlasting</hi> Kingdom, prepared by the Father, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased by the Son for you. Of which Kingdom we have many things to say, and <hi>hard to be</hi> uttered. Indeed as high the Heavens are above our Heads; so high above our understanding, and apprehension is the Glory and Felicity of Heaven. No greater dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt the <hi>Throne,</hi> and the <hi>Footstool,</hi> nor so great indeed as betwixt the Kingdom of Heaven, and the most flourishing Kingdoms upon Earth. What is said of Mount <hi>Sion</hi> (the Type,) <hi>Psal.</hi> 48.2. <hi>Beautiful for Situation, the joy of the whole
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:34554:150"/>Earth is Mount</hi> Zion: The like may much more be said of Heaven; Beautiful for Situation, the Joy, yea, the Glory of the whole World. Here is the City of the great King. O the <hi>serenity</hi> of Heaven! no scorching heat, nor piercing cold there. Here is a glorious Kingdom indeed, above the Clouds, yea, above the Stars.</p>
               <p>O the Lightsomeness of Heaven! no Night there. And no need of the Sun there, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.5. O the <hi>pleasures</hi> of Heaven! Paradise was but an obscure Type, a dark shadow of it. No pricking Brier, or <hi>grieving Thorn</hi> there. In this Kingdom there is nothing to offend. No sorrow nor crying there. No pain there, no <hi>feeble</hi> person among the heavenly Tribes: There is health without sickness, and joy without sorrow, and pleasures without pain. There is hidden Mannah, and Rivers of pleasures, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fading Crowns of Glory.</p>
               <p>O the <hi>riches</hi> of that Kingdom, there are Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures that fail not. <hi>Solomon</hi> made <hi>Silver</hi> to be in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> as <hi>stones,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.27. But the new <hi>Jerusalem</hi> is described and represented, as if it were all <hi>Gold, and precious stones,</hi> Rev. 21.18, 19, 20. Many a poor man goes to Heaven, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.5. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poor in this world, yet rich in Faith, and <hi>Heirs of the Kingdom.</hi> But that Kingdom will for ever enrich all that come to it. There, and there only is the enduring <hi>substance.</hi> So now it is poor <hi>Dives,</hi> poor <hi>Dives,</hi> who is shut out of Heaven, but rich <hi>Lazarus.</hi> No <hi>poor to be seen</hi> in the streets of the New <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> no complaining in those streets.</p>
               <p>O the <hi>peaceableness</hi> of that Kingdom! no Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in the Coelestial Paradise, no <hi>Cananite</hi> in that Land of Promise, neither the Alarm of War, nor
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:34554:150"/>the Voice of the Oppressor that shall ever be heard there. No hurting or destroying in that holy Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, no possibility of a <hi>Forreign Invasion.</hi> There is a great Gulf fixed, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.26. No fear of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testine <hi>Divisions</hi> in that Kingdom. There Love shall be perfect. There <hi>Luther,</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed. There is the <hi>sweetest Harmony</hi> without the least jarring Discord. There the Faithful dwell at ease, and delight themselves in the abundance of Peace.</p>
               <p>O the <hi>Stability</hi> and Permanency of this Kingdom! And this Crowns all the rest; it is an everlasting Kingdom: The New <hi>Jerusalem</hi> lieth <hi>four square,</hi> (it is a Kingdom that cannot be moved) the Length and the Breadth, and the Height of it <hi>are equal,</hi> Rev. 21.16. it is ever like it self. The Glory of Heaven shall never suffer the least <hi>Eclipse.</hi> O bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed state indeed, to be <hi>ever with the Lord!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But after all, I must tell you, we have but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry short sight of those things that are <hi>within the veil.</hi> Indeed did Believers fully apprehend the <hi>Riches of the Glory</hi> of that Inheritance reserved in Heaven for them, they would stand in need of more <hi>patience,</hi> to be willing to stay their time, God hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them upon Earth, (though they should live in the most <hi>flourishing</hi> and prosperous Estate here;) than ever the Martyrs stood in need of, to endure the most grievous Tortures, and cruel Deaths.</p>
               <p>Thus you have heard something of the First and grand Covenant promised <hi>[I will be your God]</hi> how wonderful comprehensive it is. It is as high <hi>as Heaven,</hi> What canst thou know? The Measure thereof is longer than the Earth, and broader than the Sea.</p>
               <pb n="292" facs="tcp:34554:151"/>
               <p>Again, the second is like unto it, <hi>scil. [Ye shall be my people,]</hi> Jer. 31.33.</p>
               <p>It is true, sometimes this imports <hi>our Duty,</hi> and the Condition of the Covenant. And if we would have God for our God, we must be his people, we must give up our selves to Him, and account our selves no more our own. But to <hi>be his People,</hi> as well holds forth the exceeding great <hi>Priviledge,</hi> and Happiness of those, that indeed give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to God, that come up to Covenant Terms. That God will own, and acknowledge them <hi>for his people</hi> indeed, and will carry it towards them as such, will remember them with the Favour that he beareth to his People.</p>
               <p>His Professing people, who have given up their Names, but do not give up their hearts to him, yet have some <hi>priviledges</hi> above others, that are not called by his Name, much more that his willing, and Obedient people are priviledged. The Lord knoweth them that are his, (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19.) and will own them. And</p>
               <p n="1">1. This speaketh their <hi>freedom from other Lords.</hi> Those cruel Task-masters, and Tyrants; Sin, the World, and Satan. Gods owning them for his, will cut off others claims; Sin, the World, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, can no more <hi>lay claim</hi> to you, if ye be the <hi>Lords.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As that eminent Saint, and Servant of God, Mr. <hi>Joseph Allein,</hi> (in his Life, <hi>p.</hi> 92.) did thus repel Satan in his last Conflict: <q>Trouble me not (says he) for I am <hi>none of thine,</hi> I am the Lords: His by Covenant, I have sworn my self to be the Lords, and his <hi>I will be,</hi> therefore be gone.</q> So if the Lord saith of thee, such a soul is <hi>mine,</hi> his
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:34554:151"/>Title (no doubt) will hold good against Satan, and all the World.</p>
               <p>O what a comfortable thing it is, if indeed you are the Lords, then you are <hi>Redeemed</hi> unto him from among men. You are no longer Satans cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, no longer slaves to Sin, and the World; as it is <hi>Isa.</hi> 62.12. <hi>They shall call them the holy people, the redeemed of the Lord.</hi> And <hi>Isa.</hi> 43.1. <hi>Fear not, for I have redeemed thee,— thou are mine.</hi> You are his, as <hi>Redeemed by him;</hi> you are the Portion which he took out of the hand of Satan, with his Sword, and with his Bow, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.34. <hi>Hath God assayed to go and take him a Nation from the midst of another Nation, by Temptations, by Signs, and Wonders, by a mighty Hand and stretched-out Arm, and by great Terrours, according to all that the Lord your God did for you in</hi> Egypt? O the <hi>exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Greatness</hi> of his Power to us-ward that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; delivering us from the power of Darkness, and Translating us into the Kingdom of his Dear Son.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This putteth an <hi>Honour,</hi> an Excellency upon any. Since thou wast <hi>precious in mine Eyes,</hi> thou hast <hi>been honourable:</hi> What a great Honour is it unto any, for the Great God to own them, as in near Relation unto Him? What she said of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> servants, is much more true of Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.8. <hi>Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee.</hi> As there is no <hi>God like</hi> him, so no People in the World like his People, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.20, 21. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.9. <hi>The Lords portion is his People.</hi> Exod. 19.5. <hi>A peculiar Treasure</hi> unto him, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.17. <hi>His Jewels.</hi> Does not this commend them indeed,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:34554:152"/>as the <hi>Excellent ones</hi> in the Earth, that God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts so highly of them? <hi>Psal.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Know that the Lord hath set apart, him that is Godly for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi> Set apart, or, as some Translate it, <hi>Miri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficavit;</hi> or <hi>Insignem vel eximium fecit.</hi> The differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence God putteth betwixt his People, and others, the Godly and the Ungodly, is <hi>Notable</hi> and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, The wicked he will put away <hi>like Dross,</hi> but the Godly he esteemeth as his <hi>Jewels;</hi> these he accounteth his <hi>peculiar Treasure:</hi> He sets great store by them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Gods peculiar People have his <hi>special Favour:</hi> And what happiness in this? The Psalmist desired no more, but that the Lord would remember him with the Favour that he beareth to his People, <hi>Psal.</hi> 106.4. <hi>The Lord taketh pleasure in his people,</hi> Psal. 149.4. These only have his <hi>Complacential</hi> Love. Those whom he calleth his People, at other times he calleth his <hi>Chosen,</hi> his Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, his <hi>Beloved;</hi> yea, the Apple of his Eye: Relation and Propriety is a potent Exciter of Love. The world that is full of Malice, yet lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth its own. And shall not God love his own? Yea, he loveth them with an everlasting Love.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For God to say of any, they are <hi>mine,</hi> it speaks <hi>Safety.</hi> He will have a <hi>care of his own.</hi> His Inheritance is Hedged, Fenced about with his special Providence. His People shall have his <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</hi> A dangerous thing it is for men to meddle with them. <hi>What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces,</hi> Isa. 3.15. Do ye know what ye do, <hi>Isa.</hi> 52.5, 6. What is here to do, <hi>That my people is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away for nought.</hi> God will Judge and Plead for his People, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.36. <hi>Isa.</hi> 51.22. <hi>Joel</hi> 3.2,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:34554:152"/>4. You would not see your Children wronged. And will not God avenge his own Elect? He is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>tender</hi> of the <hi>Apple of his Eye:</hi> And the Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the Lord shall dwell in safety by him, yea, the Foundation of God standeth sure; the Lord knoweth them that are his. And the very Gates of Hell shall not prevail against them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. His People are sure to be <hi>well provided</hi> for. Doth God take care for Oxen? Does he give the Beasts their Food, and will he not much more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for them of his own Houshold? His Blessing is upon his People, <hi>Psal.</hi> 3.8. <hi>My people shall be satisfied with my Goodness, saith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 31.14. Yea, others must not see the Good he will do for them, they have Meat to eat that the World knows not of.</p>
               <p n="6">6. His People shall have his <hi>special presence,</hi> Ezek. 37.27. <hi>My Tabernacle shall be with them: Yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</hi> So in other places, where the Lord promiseth to own any as his People; he doth further promise to dwell among them, and walk among them, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.12. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where should God dwell, but in the Lot of his own Inheritance?</p>
               <p n="7">7. When you hear of <hi>Gods Tabernacle</hi> being with them; you must not understand it, so, as if he were Flitting, or Removing from them again. No, <hi>The Lord will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his Inheritance,</hi> Psal. 94.14. <hi>God hath not cast away his people whom he fore-knew,</hi> Rom. 11.2. He will not cast any of them away. He will not lose one of his <hi>Jewels.</hi> None shall pluck them out of his Hand. He will keep them safe, till he set them in a <hi>Crown of Glory.</hi>

               <p>And so lastly, They that are his indeed, it doth <hi>not yet appear what they shall be;</hi> but this is certain, they shall at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>t appear with him in Glory. Yea, the Lord will be for ever glorified in them, as a Bridegroom adorneth himself with Ornaments, and as a Bride decketh her self with her Jewels. And what Glory that is, to be <hi>like the Angels</hi> of Light as to our souls; and to have our <hi>vile bodies made like unto Christs glorious Body,</hi> no Tongue can express. <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his glory, not like one of these. When Christ was <hi>Transfigured in the Mount</hi> his very Raiment was shining, exceeding white as snow: So as no Fuller on Earth can white them, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.8. His very Raiment received Light and Lustre from his Body. His Face shone as the Sun, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.2. And if the appearance of Christ was so Glorious in that Mount, which was but a <hi>Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skip of Heaven;</hi> What a glorious Body hath he now in Heaven? Well? The bodies of the Saints are to be Fashioned like his glorious Body, never to change that Fashion more. O the Lustre that God will put upon his People, when the Righteous shall <hi>shine forth as the Sun,</hi> in the Kingdom of their Father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.43. And if the Body the earthly part of them, shall be so full of Splendor, How Glorious within, think we? Will not God polish the Jewel, when the Ring where it is set, is so En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amelled, when the Cabinet hath so rich work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on it?</p>
               <p>And now my Friends, consider of what hath been said, and shew your selves men. You have heard what the Lord requireth of you in the Covenant of Grace; nothing but what is your Indispensible Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; nothing that you can deny, or be backward to,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:34554:153"/>if you be not enemies to God, and your own souls, which should prevail with you, though there were nothing more to be said. But further you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so heard, what the Lord hath freely and graciously promised here, even all that you can desire to your salvation and endless Happiness; yea, even more than you can conceive of. Now what say ye? Will ye be the Lords? Will you now from this day for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards give up your selves to God in Christ, to be Ruled by him, and saved by him in his own Way? O that there were such an heart in you all! Sirs, what say you? Though I be the unworthiest of Gods Messengers, yet I come in his Name, and the Lord expects your answer. Ah, Sirs, Have you not Delayed, and Dallied with God too long al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready? Whosoever thou art that shall deny to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to Gods Terms this day, for ought thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, this is the <hi>last time of asking:</hi> The Lord may never offer thee so fair again: That if this day thou dost not hearken to his Voice, the things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto thy peace, may be for ever hid from thine eyes. If now you will be the Lords, then he will be your God, and own you for his People indeed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.21, 22. But if otherwise, do not say, but you have been fairly offered: And how will you for ever repent it, and Rue your folly, that you did not take Gods offer? O madness indeed, that you should like it to have the Bramble reign over you, rather than come under the shadow of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty! Do you not chuse sin, and the world, to your own Confusion? This know, God hath no need of you, he can be happy without you; though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him you are miserable to all Eternity.</p>

                  </gap>, <hi>a Seculo,</hi> or from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the World, the Antient Gospel. That pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, [That the Seed of the Woman, should break the Serpents head.] Was the first Draught, or <hi>Epitome</hi> of the Gospel. Here God promised the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:34554:154"/>destruction of Satans Kingdom, and Salvation of Fallen man, by <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> the Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. That all the <hi>true Seed</hi> of the Woman, the Faithful, (opposed to the seed of the Serpent,) should overcome through him, who <hi>is the Seed</hi> of the Woman <hi>eminently,</hi> and in a more famous sense, and peculiar respect.

Now how could sinners look to find <hi>acceptance,</hi> whose best services are imperfect, and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to be rejected, unless God reveal himself in a gracious promise, or Covenant to that purpose. By <hi>Faith Abel offered</hi> unto God a more excellent Sacrifice than <hi>Cain,</hi> by which he obtained witness that he was Righteous, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.4. This is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that Remission of sin, Justification, and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation (the great benefits promised in the Covenant of Grace) were <hi>granted out to some,</hi> before the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham.</hi> So <hi>Abel</hi> was righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous before God: So <hi>Enoch,</hi> who walked with God on Earth, and was Translated, and taken up to God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.24.

As Christ saith, John 7.17. <hi>If any man doth his will, he shall know of the Doctrine; whether it be of God, or whether I speak of my self.</hi> As such whose hearts were right, and sound, the Gospel being revealed to them with such clear Evidence, and proof, that it was of God, they could not but <hi>embrace it.</hi> As that Faith by which <hi>Abraham</hi> obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Gods call to leave his Country, and Kindred, and Fathers House, to go <hi>he knew not whither;</hi> would have enabled him to leave Father and Mother, House and Land, for Christs sake, and the Gospels. That <hi>same Faith,</hi> which made him so ready to offer up <hi>Isaac</hi> at Gods command, would have made him as willing to take <hi>up the Cross</hi> and follow Christ, as the Apostles and Primitive Christians did, had he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in their dayes. The like may be said of the <hi>Fathers before him,</hi> who obtained a good report through Faith. Thus it appeareth, that there is no real difference, betwixt the Faith of those VVor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, who lived in former Ages, to whom God spake <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> at divers times, and in divers manners, and the Faith of Christians, to whom God hath spoken by his Son.</p>
               <p>Now though I have <hi>jumbled</hi> things together some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing confusedly in this Discourse: Yet ye may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve these two things cleared sufficiently, that the same <hi>substantial Benefits,</hi> which the Gospel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth, were held forth to the Fathers; and the <hi>same kind</hi> of Faith, Holiness, and Obedience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them, and therefore they must needs have
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:34554:156"/>been under the same Covenant for substance.</p>
               <p>And is not this a Crediting of the Gospel? And should it not confirm our Faith in the Gospel? This is the <hi>good old Way</hi> indeed, many are greatly addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to Antiquity. You make great account of your <hi>old Deeds</hi> and Evidences. Let me tell you, you do not conceive aright of the Gospel, nor of Gods Grace, if you confine it to the Time of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> as if it was under 1700. years old. Even the Covenant of God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> was 430. years before the <hi>Mosaical Law</hi> (as the Apostle urgeth against those, who were ready to adhere to the Law <hi>in opposition</hi> to the Gospel.) And though that was sufficient for his purpose there, yet the Covenant of Grace was <hi>long before Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> even from the beginning. This way God had set forth soon after Man was placed upon the Earth, <hi>immediately upon his fall.</hi> And it is questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, whether <hi>Adam</hi> stood one day, whether he <hi>lodged</hi> one night in that <hi>Honour,</hi> to which he was Created.</p>
               <p>O how should we <hi>reverence</hi> the Gospel! how should this advance the Grace of God in our thoughts! It is the <hi>antient Gospel,</hi> the everlasting Gospel, like the everlasting Hills; even from the beginning, God set forth this way of Salvation. The Gospel deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by Christ, and his Apostles, what is it, but that <hi>good old Charter,</hi> granted to Man upon the Fall, graciously renewed? VVhen almost the whole Race of Mankind had forfeited, and <hi>lost their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> Christ comes, and renews, and Confirms it.</p>
               <p>But here another Question falleth in.</p>
               <p>VVhether the Covenant of Grace was made with all in <hi>Adam?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="304" facs="tcp:34554:157"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I think we must yield to this, <hi>Perpetua est foederis Dei ratio, quod filii in parentibus comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danter &amp; censeanter:</hi> That this is the perpetual way and manner of Gods Covenant, to include and reckon the <hi>Children with their parents.</hi> Thus the Covenant of Grace was made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and his Seed, such as were to Descend from him, till such time as any of them Degenerated <hi>into the seed of the Serpent,</hi> and by their wilful Apostacy from God, and his VVayes, they did <hi>cut off themselves, and theirs</hi> from the Covenant. As afterwards the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed; and as now, under the Gospel the Covenant is made with the Faithful and their Seed: So was it at first with <hi>Adam and his Seed.</hi> But as now if any that are taken into Covenant upon the account of their Parents, being in Covenant with God, if when they shall grow up, they shall <hi>wilfully reject Grace</hi> offered, and manifestly renounce their Covenant with God; they should thereby <hi>break off themselves</hi> from their former Covenant-relation to God: So this hath been the case of the far greater part of <hi>Adams</hi> Posterity.</p>
               <p>Though whether the <hi>Law of</hi> Grace may not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend further, even to such as are not in Covenant, in the fullest sense, as it implieth a mutual consent; that is another Question.</p>
               <p>But so much of the Covenant, or Law of Grace, as it was given to <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That God might reveal more concerning it to the <hi>Fathers even before the Flood,</hi> I know no ground to deny. VVe read of <hi>Enochs</hi> Prophecy, <hi>Jude</hi> 5.14.15. That God was manifesting himself to some of his Servants in those times <hi>extraordinarily.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="305" facs="tcp:34554:157"/>
               <p>But the next Edition of the Covenant, that we find extant, was that <hi>made to Abraham.</hi> And this latter Edition of the Covenant of Grace was <hi>larger,</hi> and <hi>clearer</hi> than the former. That Channel of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, which first brake forth in Paradise immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately upon Mans Fall, ran down to <hi>Abraham</hi> in a <hi>broader stream.</hi> Here Christ is spoken of, as the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was spoken of more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally before, as the <hi>Seed of the Woman.</hi> And bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness is promised in and by him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.18. <hi>In thy Seed shall all the Nations of the Earth be blessed.</hi> Which blessedness before was more obscurely hinted in that phrase <hi>of breaking the Serpents head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here is express mention of Gods Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>Abraham, Gen,</hi> 17.2, 4, 7, 9, 10. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Gods <hi>Covenanting with Adam,</hi> and others of the Faithful before, is not plainly laid down, but only to be gathered, and deduced from Scripture by way of Inference. Though methinks, it is plain enough to all, that are not minded to Cavil, that there was a Covenant betwixt God and <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp;c. they being <hi>mutually engaged.</hi> God engaged to <hi>Adam</hi> by promise, and <hi>Adam</hi> engaged to believe God, and worship God, according as he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal himself. But whereas the Covenant was more <hi>tacitly and darkly</hi> held forth, betwixt God and <hi>Adam,</hi> it is most expresly delared betwixt God and <hi>Abraham,</hi> so that there is no room for any Cavil.</p>
               <p>Now that the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> was the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> the same for Substance with that we are under, is evident.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Gospel was preached</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi> in that Covenant, which is proved by the Apostles express Testimony, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8.</p>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:34554:158"/>
               <p n="2">2. The Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> was <hi>confirmed in Christ,</hi> Gal. 3.17. Therefore a Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> has not yet been disanulled, as the Apostle there shews; and thence proveth, the blessing of <hi>Abraham</hi> is come upon the <hi>Gentiles</hi> according to the tenor of that Covenant.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified by Faith in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, confirmed or renewed in the Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.4. That he should be a Father of many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, see <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.5, 6. Now hence it will follow, either that the Promise, and Covenant made to <hi>Abraham</hi> was a <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> or that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was not justified <hi>by a Covenant of Grace,</hi> but some other way. Either the Promise, and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made to him, was the <hi>same for substance</hi> with that we are under, or he was justified and saved in a quite different way from us.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And then why should he be called <hi>the Father of the Faithful,</hi> Rom. 14.11, 16, 17. Or why should Gospel Believers be called the Children of <hi>Abraham, Gal.</hi> 3.7. He is not the <hi>Father of such,</hi> in respect of Natural Generation, or Spiritual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, does not beget or produce Faith in them; but only by <hi>similitude</hi> and proportion, as a famous Pattern and eminent Example; as look what way <hi>Abraham</hi> found acceptance with God, and was justified before God, and we may expect the Favour of God, and free Justification in the same way. But certainly you take away the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> of the agreement, and Relation betwixt <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Faithful. Now, if you deny that to be the Covenant of Grace, which was made with <hi>Abraham:</hi> Can they be of the same Faith,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:34554:158"/>who are not under the same Covenant?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Do we not read, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.14. That the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, which is come upon the <hi>Gentiles</hi> through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, was first the <hi>blessing of Abraham.</hi> It was first the blessing of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and from him, and through him, (as a <hi>prime</hi> subject, though not <hi>as a cause</hi>) it descends upon us. The Gospel, or the glad Tidings of Christ, and blessedness in him was <hi>first preached to Abraham, [In thy Seed shall all the Nations of the Earth be blessed.]</hi> And thus by Faith in the Promise <hi>he saw the day of</hi> Christ, the Messias coming, though it was at a great distance; yet he believed it would come, and <hi>be a happy day</hi> indeed, the fore-thoughts whereof made him glad at heart, <hi>John</hi> 8.56.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. But some tell us the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> was not the <hi>Covenant of Grace;</hi> for that is one and the same to all the Faithful: But in this Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> are <hi>special promises,</hi> agreeing only to him and his Family, or Natural Off-spring, as that the Messiah should come of his Seed, <hi>Even He, in whom all Nations should be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;</hi> and that God would give the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to his Seed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> We must distinguish betwixt the <hi>Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials</hi> of the Covenant of Grace, and the <hi>acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.</hi> As the Covenant of Grace holds forth the way of Salvation for Fallen Mankind of Gods Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace in Christ; so it is <hi>the same Covenant,</hi> that <hi>Abraham</hi> was under, and the Faithful now are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And as to the now-mentioned Differences, they were but <hi>Circumstantial,</hi> and <hi>accidental.</hi> This Distinction must be granted, or else we must hold the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and House of <hi>David</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:34554:159"/>
                  <hi>in one Covenant,</hi> and the other Tribes, with all the <hi>Jewish</hi> Proselytes in another Covenant; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Scripture Involves and Comprehends them <hi>in one and the same Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. Others say, God made a two-fold Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. Scil. A <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace,</hi> in the beginning of the Chapter, and a Covenant of Circumcision, <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which they make a Covenant of Works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> But this is a mistake sure, for so it would follow, 1. That whereas <hi>Abraham</hi> is acknowledged to be taken into a <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> before, he had the priviledge after this, to be taken into the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works;</hi> which is no priviledge. 2. They must say, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was at the same time both under a <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> and a Covenant of Works. But these same persons at other times de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that one can be under <hi>both Covenants</hi> together. 3. The Apostle is express, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. That <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> received the sign <hi>of Circumcision,</hi> a <hi>seal of the Righteousness of Faith.</hi> So that if the Covenant to which Circumcision did belong, was a Covenant of Works (as Mr. <hi>P.</hi> would have it:) the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Faith should belong to the Covenant of Works. 4. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. Doth not speakof a <hi>two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Covenant</hi> made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> but sets forth <hi>both parts</hi> of the Covenant, <hi>scil.</hi> What the Lord <hi>promised</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and what he <hi>required</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</hi> He promised to be a God unto him, and to his Seed after him, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. And required <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> to walk before him in Integrity, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. And to submit to the Ordinance of Circumcision, <hi>v.</hi> 10. VVhich at that time he appointed to be the <hi>sign of the Covenant:</hi> He calleth it [My Covenant.] But
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:34554:159"/>methinks it is strange, that any Protestant should stumble at the Expression. It is a Sacramental phrase, like that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. <hi>That Rock was Christ.</hi> And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24. <hi>This is my Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, look at the <hi>Spiritual meaning</hi> of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, as it was a bloody Sacrament, intimating the purging away of sin by the Blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and pointing at the inward Circumcision of the heart; what can be more plain, than that it must refer <hi>to the Covenant of Grace?</hi> But I may have occasion to speak more of this by and by.</p>
               <p>Lastly, That there was but one Covenant esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished with <hi>Abraham,</hi> this appears (as Mr. <hi>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi> noteth <hi>p.</hi> 36.) <q>From the constant phrase of Scripture, always (where speaking of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with <hi>Abraham</hi>) speaking in the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular number, the Covenant, and not in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, Covenants.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now I might go on to shew how God repeated his Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> as it were <hi>Comment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> upon it, in which respect it may be called the <hi>Promises, Gal.</hi> 3.16. so <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.1, 2, 3. and 15.1.5. and 17. and 22.17, 18. And I have heard a Learned man observe from Gods commanding <hi>Abraham</hi> to offer up his son <hi>Isaac,</hi> that on Gods part it was a <hi>further Exhibition</hi> of the Messiah to <hi>Abraham. Isaac</hi> must be the blessed Seed, or the Progenitor of it, because of that Promise, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.12. In <hi>Isaac</hi> shall thy Seed be called. Now <hi>Isaac's usage</hi> (being appointed to be offered up a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice) holds forth to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that the Messias <hi>should be offered</hi> up a Sacrifice for sin.
<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>W.</hi>
                  </note> (So that here was more of Goodness in God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> than of Obedience in <hi>Abraham</hi> to God.)
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:34554:160"/>Again, there was a <hi>determinate place</hi> where <hi>Isaac,</hi> should be offered, <hi>Mount Moriah,</hi> on which place af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the Temple, the place of sacrifices, was built. Again, <hi>Isaac</hi> was laid on the wood, and <hi>Abrahams</hi> hand <hi>stretched out,</hi> to slay him: Yet <hi>Abrahams</hi> hand was stayed, <hi>Isaac</hi> was not Sacrificed, but God provided a Ram <hi>for a Sacrifice;</hi> this teacheth <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> that the time of Messiahs coming was not yet: But in the mean time God would be content with Sacrifices, <hi>as Pledges</hi> of the Messiah, which should <hi>Supponere locum Messiae,</hi> should be Typical, Significative, and Representative of him. Here I have given you anothers thoughts of that Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious passage, of Gods commanding <hi>Abraham</hi> to offer his son <hi>Isaac.</hi> But whether indeed <hi>Abraham</hi> had a <hi>distinct apprehension</hi> of these things, as we may have, since they have been cleared, and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated in the <hi>Antitype,</hi> I do not determine; but leave to others Judgments.</p>
               <p>I come next to speak of the Covenant made with the Children of <hi>Israel.</hi> Here some distinguish of the Covenant made with them <hi>under Moses,</hi> till their return from the Babylonish Captivity, and the Covenant made with them after the Captivity. But that I may not run out too far, I shall only speak of the <hi>Mosaick Covenant:</hi> as indeed of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is all the Question, whether it was a <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> the same for substance with that, which Christians are under. Now I shall endeavour to clear this, That the Covenant of God made by <hi>Moses</hi> with the people of the <hi>Jews, was a Covenant of Grace,</hi> the same for substance with the Gospel-Covenant: The way of Life and Salvation held forth in it.</p>
               <pb n="311" facs="tcp:34554:160"/>
               <p>It is <hi>granted,</hi> or if any should deny or question it, we have seen it proved before, that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> was a <hi>Covenant of grace;</hi> But the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> took in the <hi>Jews,</hi> as his seed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. And the Covenant made with the <hi>Jews,</hi> was a carrying on and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing of the same Covenant; (though with a new <hi>modus,</hi> some things peculiar to the Jewish Church and Common-wealth, being added to it,) <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.18. Thou shalt remember the Lord thy God, that he may <hi>establish his Covenant,</hi> which he sware unto thy Fathers. And <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.12. If ye hearken to these Judgments, and keep and do them, the Lord thy God shall keep unto thee the Covenant and Mercy, which he sware unto thy Fathers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Covenant which was Sealed with the <hi>sign of Circumcision,</hi> and had a promise of Heart-Circumcision, was a Covenant of Grace. But the Covenant made with the <hi>Jews,</hi> was sealed with the sign of Circumcision; and further, had a promise of Heart-circumcision.</p>
               <p>What did the outward sign of Circumcision sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie? That we learn, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.16. Circumcise therefore the <hi>Fore-skin</hi> of <hi>your heart,</hi> which hath its accomplishment in Christ: <hi>Veteres Hebraei in eâ fuerunt sententiâ, quod tempore Messiae Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisio Spiritualiter, non Carnaliter amplius fieri de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beat.</hi> Fag. apud M. Pool. in Synops. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11, 12. In whom ye are Circumcised with the <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision made without hands,</hi> in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh, by the Circumcision of Christ, buried with him in Baptism. Where me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks the Apostle intimates thus much, <hi>that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>'s <hi>Circumcision,</hi> the outward circumcision made
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:34554:161"/>with hands, did point to Christs <hi>Circumcision,</hi> the inward Circumcision not made with hands, [The Circumcision of Christ.] <hi>i. e.</hi> That which he effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by his Spirit. And this further we may take notice of, that he seemeth to compare <hi>Circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and Baptism, as signifying the same thing, [Buried with him in Baptism.]</p>
               <p>Here let me Recite a Passage out of a Late Writer.

<pb n="313" facs="tcp:34554:161"/>promise of Grace, where the Lord undertakes to work, what else-where he requires, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.16. <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Object.</hi> But then why is the House of <hi>Israel</hi> said to have been <hi>Ʋncircumcised in heart? Answ.</hi> They were so generally, This Promise (like those <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26, 27.) was fulfilled only in some of them, not in all, (its true) and yet laid down in so general Terms as might have encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged any of them to apply themselves to God, for the bestowing of that Grace upon them.</p>
               <p>But there is an Objection against this Argument from Circumcision, from <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3. Every man that is circumcised, is a <hi>Debtor to do the whole Law.</hi> And consequently, circumcision should rather have reference to a Covenant of Works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is a mistake, to confound the <hi>Law</hi> (of which the Apostle there speaketh) with the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works,</hi> or covenant made with man <hi>in Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</hi> The Law to which Circumcision bound men, was the written Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> which though it is sometimes called the <hi>Law of Works,</hi> yet is really distinct from the <hi>Law of Innocency,</hi> or <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works</hi> made with man at first. Indeed the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Jewish Law, taken in the <hi>Political sence,</hi> as it was the Instrument, or Rule of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Jews</hi> Common-wealth (as one notes) promising Temporal bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits to the strict observation thereof,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Discourse of the two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants.</hi> p. 75.</note> and threatning Temporal penalties to the Transgression and Violation of the same; <hi>So far</hi> it was a Law of Works. A <hi>Law of Works</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. As the Apostle saith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.12. The <hi>Law is not of Faith: But the man that Doth them, shall live in them,</hi> (as <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.5.) Which as it had reference
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:34554:162"/>to the Law in <hi>the Political sence,</hi> is to be understood of a long and prosperous life upon Earth.</p>
               <p>Further, as the false Apostles and carnal <hi>Jews</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Justification, and Salvation, upon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Observation of the Law, as if Circumcision, and other works of the Law were highly Meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous (<hi>Rom.</hi> 9, 32. and 10.3.) Thus it was to them a <hi>supposed Law, or Covenant of Works.</hi> Not that God did so intend it, but they did so misapprehend it. Not that Circumcision did indeed bind men to the strict Terms of the <hi>proper Covenant of Works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Apostle there speaks of Circumcision, in the <hi>sence of the false Apostles,</hi> and as they abused it. They urged it as necessary to Justification, as <hi>a work of the Law,</hi> setting <hi>Moses</hi> against Christ: And would have it still practised, when by Christ it was <hi>abolished.</hi> Against these, the Apostle argues, if you will keep up circumcision still, by the same reason, you must <hi>keep up all Iewish Ceremonies,</hi> and observe the whole <hi>Mosaical</hi> Law, to which Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision did oblige them.</p>
               <p>But observe it, the use of Circumcision as insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by God, was not to bind them to Legally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and <hi>sinless Obedience;</hi> nor did <hi>Abraham,</hi> or any faithful <hi>Jew</hi> so understand it. So indeed it would have been no priviledge at all;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1.</note> so it would have been no happiness or <hi>advantage,</hi> but a misery; and terror for them to have been taken into Covenant with God by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision. But though compared with the more <hi>easie Institutions</hi> of the Gospel, circumcision was a Yoke, binding them to that <hi>more burdensome</hi> way of Service, which God at that time had appointed; yet comparing their estate then, with that <hi>of the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:34554:162"/>Heathen,</hi> circumcision was an Honourable Badge of them, whom God owned as his <hi>peculiar people.</hi> And though as Circumcision had relation to their political Law, it bound them to the strict Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of those Statutes, <hi>Judgments and Ordinances,</hi> which God had given them in <hi>special:</hi> Yet as it had relation to the covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed, which was still on <hi>foot,</hi> it only bound them to serve and obey God in sincerity and truth, in what he then revealed to be his Will; and so much is (no doubt) required of every one in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace. Again,</p>
               <p n="3">3. That covenant which holds forth Salvation to Fallen man, cannot be the covenant of works, but the covenant of Grace. But the covenant made with the <hi>Jews,</hi> held forth Salvation to them, <hi>John</hi> 4.22. <hi>Salvation is of the Jews:</hi> So it was while they were in covenant. And upon this account the Land of <hi>Judah</hi> might be called Emphatically, <hi>The Land of the Living.</hi> Theirs was the Land of the Living, and the Valley of Vision: Whereas other People sat in Darkness, and <hi>in the Region and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Death,</hi> Psal. 132.16. I will clothe her Priests with Salvation: <hi>Ministerium eorum reddam salutare populo meo: Id quod eis erit honorificum, non secus ac elegans Vestis.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Piscat.</note> By their Ministration (standing in his councel) they might both save themselves, and others, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.22. And they that were <hi>aliens from the Common-wealth</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> and strangers from the Covenant of Promise, are set forth as having <hi>no hope,</hi> and without God in the world, <hi>Ep.</hi> 2.12. Implying, 1. That the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had <hi>no grounded hope</hi> of future Happiness. 2. The <hi>Jews</hi> had or might have had such hope. 3. What ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:34554:163"/>hope they had of future Happiness, it depended, or was built <hi>and bottomed on the Covenant,</hi> then on foot. Called <hi>Covenants,</hi> being divers times renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though otherwise for substance, it was but one. So again, Rom. 9.4. <hi>Ʋna fuit promissio, si remip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sam spectes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Beza.</note>
                  <hi>sed saepius sancita.</hi> It was at se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times renewed, and though the <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and substance of it was the same, yet it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in <hi>sundry forms</hi> in various Expressions. Or if by [Covenants] we understand, <hi>Et foedus gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae communis, &amp; faedus peculiaritatis:</hi> Both the general covenant which God maketh with all his People, chiefly about their Eternal Happiness; and that special covenant made with the People of the <hi>Jews,</hi> about their prosperity in <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise; the latter was but an Appendix, not a thing opposite to the former.</p>
               <p>Now if Salvation was of the <hi>Jews</hi> (as is already proved) it undeniably follows, that <hi>the Covenant of Grace</hi> was made with the <hi>Jews,</hi> as well as with us Christians. Surely, none that consider what they say, will dare to affirm that they might have Salvation, though <hi>under a Covenant of Works,</hi> and not of Grace. And as the way of Salvation was alwayes one and the same, to wit, <hi>through a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour;</hi> so the covenant of Grace in all Ages for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, was one and the same. <hi>Jesus Christ, the same yesterday and to day, and for ever,</hi> Heb. 13.8.</p>
               <p>Here (by the way) observe, how grosly they are mistaken, that hold, the <hi>Jews</hi> had only Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral promises. A <hi>bold-fac'd Assertion,</hi> contrary to plain Scripture. If the <hi>Jews</hi> had no promises, but only of Temporal things, what shall we make of that Text, <hi>John</hi> 5.39. <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> (where
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:34554:163"/>certainly our Saviour speaketh of the Scriptures of the Old Testament, the Scriptures of the New Testament (not being then Extant) <hi>Search the Scriptures</hi> (sayes he) for in them ye think ye have <hi>Eternal Life;</hi> and they are they that testifie of me. And what would they make of that Promise, <hi>[I will be their God!]</hi> The Psalmist speaketh of it as a far greater Matter to have the Lord for our God, than to have and enjoy the world, <hi>Psal.</hi> 144.15. And the Apostle seemeth to say, that God would have been ashamed, to be called, <hi>Their God in so low a sence;</hi> as including meerly some outward Temporal priviledges, and Enjoyments, and no more, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.16. This would have been little for his Honour: This would not have been to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, or <hi>give like himself,</hi> like a God. Those words spoken to <hi>Moses</hi> [I am the God of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and the God of <hi>Isaac,</hi> and the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi>] prove them not only <hi>in being still,</hi> but in a <hi>state of happiness.</hi> And so the Import of the Phrase, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.7. He that overcometh shall Inherit all things, <hi>and I will be his God.</hi> And certainly, the blessings of an earthly <hi>Canaan</hi> were not all, that God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised under the Old Testament; but <hi>Canaan it self</hi> was to them a Type of a better Countrey, that is an Heavenly. And if the Doctrine of <hi>future Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness</hi> after this Life, was not sufficiently Revealed unto, and commonly <hi>apprehended,</hi> and known a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews,</hi> one would wonder how such an one, as that <hi>Thief on the Cross,</hi> should be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it, who prayed, <hi>Lord, remember me, when thou comest into thy Kingdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That Covenant, which had the Spirit and Grace of God attending the Administration of it,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:34554:164"/>was undoubtedly a Covenant of Grace. But the covenant made with the <hi>Jews,</hi> had the <hi>Spirit and Grace of God</hi> so attending it. The Spirit was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, and Exhibited then, though not in so large a measure, as under the Gospel, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.5. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <hi>to the word that I covenanted with you,</hi> when ye came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> so my <hi>Spirit remaineth</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, <hi>Mich.</hi> 2.7. Is the Spirit of the Lord streightned? Are these his doings? Do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly? <hi>Those high Encomia</hi> given to the Law, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.7, 8, 9. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: The Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of the Lord are right, rejoycing the heart: The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightning the eyes,</hi> agree to it only, as <hi>the Spirit doth accompany</hi> it.</p>
               <p>There was the same Spirit of Faith given out under the Old Testament, though not the <hi>same mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Faith.</hi> And it was a Prayer, which a Saint under the Old Testament put up, <hi>Psal.</hi> 143.10. <hi>Teach me to do thy will, for thou art my God, thy Spirit is good: Lead me</hi> (i. e. by thy Spirit) <hi>into the Land of Ʋprightness.</hi> And there was the <hi>same Love</hi> to God, to his Word and Worship, to his Saints and Servants in the faithful of Old, as is in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, under the Gospel. And they obeyed from the same <hi>gracious Principle,</hi> as is evident from <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Jewish Sacraments did represent <hi>and signifie the same thing,</hi> as Gospel-Sacraments do; from whence it would seem to follow, that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with them is for <hi>substance,</hi> the same with that which Christians are under. Methinks it is plain, that the Apostle makes Circumcision and Baptism, the same in signification, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11, 12. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3, 4. They did all eat the <hi>same spiritual
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:34554:164"/>Meat,</hi> and they did all drink the same spiritual Drink: For they drank of that spiritual Rock, that followed them, and that Rock was Christ. Would any one imagine, that Christ should be held forth Represented, or Typified, in <hi>Sacraments</hi> relating to the <hi>Covenant of Works?</hi> That their Sacraments did Typifie Christ to come, and ours do set him forth as already come; will not prove two Covenants <hi>Essentially different,</hi> but only two different Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations of the Covenant. As it will not prove <hi>two Christs,</hi> one that was then to come, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is since come. Surely, there is but <hi>one Christ,</hi> though thus variously set forth and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That Covenant which was capable of being <hi>renewed,</hi> after it was <hi>broken,</hi> must needs be a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, and not of Works. But the covenant made with the <hi>Israelites,</hi> was <hi>capable</hi> of <hi>renewing.</hi> The covenant of Works being once broken, is irreparably broken, because it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <hi>absolute, perfect</hi> Obedience. But the People of <hi>Israel</hi> were oft called to renew their covenant with God, which sheweth it was a <hi>Covenant of Grace. Moses, Nehemiah,</hi> &amp;c. who truly feared God, and full well knew their own and others weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and utter inability to <hi>perform sinless</hi> Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, would never have been so forward to engage themselves, and others in a covenant of Works; which was impossible for them to keep, whereby they could expect nothing but a curse.</p>
               <p>The covenant of Works admitteth not of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, promiseth not Remission thereupon: But there was place for Repentance, and a promise of Pardon and Forgiveness in that covenant made with
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:34554:165"/>the <hi>Israelites, Lev.</hi> 26.40, 42. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.30, 31.</p>
               <p>There was a way appointed under the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament for the Expiation of sin. The <hi>Sacrifices</hi> under the Law were Types of Christ, and to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our obtaining Remission by his Blood. Doth the covenant of works admit of Sacrifices for sin? What a veil is over their eyes, in reading the Old Testament, that make it a covenant of works, when the great thing pointed at by its <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi> is Christ, and Redemption by him! VVill any say, the covenant of works, was Typical of the covenant of Grace?</p>
               <p n="7">7. That Covenant which had the <hi>same condition</hi> with the Gospel-covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> Sincere Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Gods Commands; is for substance the same covenant, that is, <hi>a Covenant of Grace.</hi> But the covenant made with the <hi>Jews.</hi> had this same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. The covenant of works would not <hi>take up with Sincere</hi> Obedience, but strictly requireth, and exacteth Perfect Obedience.</p>
               <p>But as God in his Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired his walking uprightly. So this was the thing required of <hi>Israel, Deut.</hi> 10.12. And now <hi>Israel,</hi> what doth the Lord thy God <hi>require of thee,</hi> but to fear the Lord thy God <hi>with all thy heart,</hi> and with all thy soul? VVhere the phrase [To serve him <hi>with all the heart,</hi> and with all the soul] is to be understood, by comparing it with other Texts, where the like phrase is used. As <hi>Deut.</hi> 30, 6. VVhere God promiseth to circumcise their heart, <hi>to love him with all their heart,</hi> and with all their soul And 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 14.8. VVhere it is said of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> that he followed the Lord <hi>with all his heart.</hi> And the like of <hi>Josiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.25. Not that
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:34554:165"/>they did all that God in his Law required of them: But God in the Covenant made with them, did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of their <hi>sincere and hearty</hi> Service, and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, though it was Imperfect; which the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works would not admit of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Phrasis illa [ex toto Corde] in multis locis Scripturae apponitur hypocrisi,</hi>

In this strict sence, no meer man in this Life; not <hi>Josiah</hi> himself, ever loved God with his whole heart, so highly as he ought. 2. These words may be considered as the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Remedying-Law, as taken with <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-lenity,</hi> as if they love God with the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bent of their souls, or above all things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>

               <p>So that when you read, <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.5. <hi>Ye shall keep my Statutes, and my Judgments, which if a man do, he shall live in them.</hi> (As in <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.29. and <hi>Ezek,</hi> 20.11.) You are not therefore to conclude, that this was a covenant of Works. Though it run in <hi>such a form,</hi> and though it is true; the carnal <hi>Jews</hi> with their Pharisaical Teachers, turned it into a covenant of Works. <hi>[Do this and live,]</hi> if you understand it, speaking of a <hi>Legal exactness,</hi> a perfect fulfilling of the Law; if you take it as a promise of Life, only upon <hi>condition of perfect</hi>
                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:34554:166"/>unsinning Obedience. So (its true) it is the plain Voice of the Covenant of Works. But as the Lord spake thus to the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> whom of his meer Grace, and Favour he had taken into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him; the words are rather to be taken in a <hi>Gospel-sence,</hi> as requiring sincere Obedience, and promising Life thereupon. And so the Faithful understood them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.6. Behold, thou <hi>desirest truth</hi> in the inward parts, <hi>ver.</hi> 16, 17.

We have not dealt <hi>falsely in thy Covenant,</hi> our heart is not turned back, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea, it is most plain, that such a keeping of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands was meant, as had a promise of <hi>Gods Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-mercy</hi> unto them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.12. and of his Shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-mercy, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.6. Where there is need of <hi>Shewing-mercy,</hi> that plainly shews, the Obedience performed not to be exactly Legal, every way per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. <hi>Shewing-mercy</hi> here, seemeth to intend, at least it concludeth, <hi>Pardoning</hi>-mercy. As it standeth in opposition to Gods visiting Iniquity, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. But supposing Obedience every way perfect, there is <hi>no room</hi> for, no need of such Mercy. Sincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience was no less <hi>accepted</hi> under the Old Testament, than under the New, (<hi>Mal.</hi> 3.17.) As it is no less <hi>required</hi> under the New Testament, than under the Old, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.21. <hi>Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that doth the will of my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> Rom. 2.7. <hi>To them who by patient continuance in well-doing, seek for Glory, Honour, and Immortality, Eternal life,</hi> ver. 13. <hi>For not</hi>

<pb n="324" facs="tcp:34554:167"/>words of <hi>Moses</hi> taken in the <hi>strict Law-sence,</hi> as a Law, and in the sence you understand them, set forth the way you stick too for Justification. For it is apparent, that those <hi>very words</hi> (Lev. 18.5.) and the whole body of the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Law, were a Covenant of Grace, as they were <hi>given</hi> from God <hi>by Moses,</hi> and understood (or intended by God) and ought to have been understood by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: The meaning was, if you indeavour to do all these sincerely, and lament your falling short, you shall live and be blessed.</q> Though he would not deny, but freely grant, that the same <hi>Mosaical</hi> Law, that is, Materially the same, was also given to Rule them, as a Common-wealth; according to the Observance, or Transgression whereof, they might look to prosper, or to be punished in this World.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That Covenant whereby the People of <hi>Israel</hi> came to have a <hi>special Interest</hi> in God, and special Priviledges above other People, could not be a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works,</hi> but of Grace. They could have had no Special priviledge by a Covenant of works, wherein naturally all are <hi>equally concern'd,</hi> and which lays sinners under the Curse, under an Intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable burden. It's impossible that sinners should come to have an <hi>Interest</hi> in God by the Covenant of works. Yet this was the <hi>Jews</hi> priviledge: The Lord was <hi>their God,</hi> Gen. 17.8. and <hi>Psal.</hi> 144.15. and 33.12. To them pertain the Adoption, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. And they have God nigh to them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.7, 8. And had the <hi>advantage</hi> clear of all others, that were strangers to the Covenant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1, 2. Had it been a Covenant of works, they should only have had <hi>God against them,</hi> not with them, or for them,

               <p>What I have added here, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to shew, that the Covenant made with the <hi>Jews,</hi> was not a Covenant of works, is to shew some, how grossely Mr. <hi>Patient</hi> is mistaken; whose loose Discourse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves not a large Refutation. Yet as weak as it is, it hath taken with some Friends of mine, whom I cannot but pity. But, Lay all these things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and I wonder if you can have any doubt, whether the Covenant made with them, was a Covenant of Grace, the same for substance with the Gospel-covenant.</p>
               <p>Yet because this is the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists,</hi> the grand Mistake, which they lie under, and which leadeth them further <hi>out of the way;</hi> for the further clearing of the Truth, I shall answer all that I can think of, which may be Objected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. That the Covenant made with the <hi>Jews,</hi> was but a <hi>Subservient-Covenant.</hi> Not the Covenant of Grace, but subservient to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It could not be Subservient to the first bringing in of the Covenant of Grace, which was in the world before this. The Covenant of Grace was <hi>made</hi> with <hi>Adam,</hi> immediately upon the Fall, and <hi>renewed</hi> with <hi>Abraham.</hi> And how could the Covenant made with the <hi>Jews,</hi> be subservient to the being of that, which was long before it? 2. Granting it was <hi>subservient to the Gospel</hi>-dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant of Grace, and preparatory to it, (as it is Gods <hi>usual Method</hi> in the works both of Nature, and Grace, to proceed from that which is less perfect, to that which is more perfect) yet
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:34554:168"/>this will not prove it <hi>no Covenant of Grace,</hi> but only that it was not so clear a Dispensation of the Covenant of Grace, as the Gospel-covenant. 3. It certainly tended to <hi>the same end,</hi> which the Gospel aimeth at; to wit, the Salvation of souls, and had the same effect, attained this end in the Faithful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews,</hi> and therefore certainly was a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, the same for substance with the Gospel covenant, and not meerly subservient to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. It was a <hi>mixt Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Though one hath raised a great dust, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed, calling it a <hi>Mixt-covenant:</hi> Of what Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples was it mixt? Was it a Mixture of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, and the Covenant of Grace? <hi>A compound</hi> of both these? But at other times, they will say these two are <hi>Incompassibilia,</hi> things that will not mix, and consist together; you may as soon <hi>mingle Heaven and Earth</hi> together. If Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Salvation be of works, then of Debt, and consequently not of Grace: So one of these plainly <hi>excludes,</hi> and overthrows the other. That either they must bring it to a Covenant of works, and not of Grace, or <hi>vice versâ,</hi> to a Covenant of Grace and not of VVorks. Or was it a mixt Covenant because it contained <hi>Temporal promises,</hi> as well as Spiritual; yet observe, this could not hinder its being a Covenant of Grace. For, 1. Those Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral good things promised were Typical of higher, and better, even of Spiritual things. An earthly <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> was <hi>a Type of Heaven.</hi> And long Life pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to the Obedient, was promised as an <hi>earnest</hi> to Eternal Life, And whatever some say and think,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:34554:168"/>this consideration would commend, and set off those outward Temporal blessings promised to the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; that they were Types and Pledges of Spiritual and Heavenly things. That they might say, as <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.19. And this was yet a <hi>small thing</hi> in thy sight, O Lord God, but thou hast also spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of thy servants for a <hi>great while to come;</hi> hast spoken what thou wilt do for us hereafter, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world. How great is thy Goodness which thou hast laid up for them, that fear thee, besides all that Goodness of thine laid out upon them here.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Gospel it self</hi> contains promises of Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, Temporal-blessings, as well as Spiritual. Christ hath promised, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6, 33. All these things <hi>shall be added,</hi> to them that seek the Kingdom of Heaven first. And still that holds good to the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, [I will <hi>never leave thee,</hi> nor forsake thee, <hi>Heb,</hi> 13.5, 6. Godliness not only heretofore had, but still hath the promise of the Life that now is, as well as of that which is to come, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. Now shall we therefore say, The Gospel is a mixt Covenant, and not a Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p>If it be replied, that in the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed, <hi>the Land of Canaan</hi> was promised, which is no where promised to Believers in the Gospel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If upon this account it must be held, a mixt Covenant, in Opposition to its being <hi>a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace;</hi> then that which made it a mixt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, must be either that this was a Temporal promise, or that it was a <hi>promise peculiarly</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seed; but neither of these could make it such a mixt Covenant. Not the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:34554:169"/>For by this Reason, the Gospel, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth, that <hi>the meek shall Inherit the Earth,</hi> Mat. 5. should be a mixt Covenant. That the promise of an Earthly <hi>Canaan</hi> should make such a mixt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and no other <hi>promise of the Earth,</hi> or Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blessings do it; is such a groundless Fancy, as will never be proved while the Earth stands.</p>
               <p>Nor the latter. For so the Gospel should be a <hi>mixt Covenant</hi> too. As the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised in special to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his seed; and as it was promised, that the Messiah should come of his seed: So in the beginning of the Gospel, there was a <hi>special promise of Miracles,</hi> to credit, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Faith of those, who first believed in Christ, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.17, 18. <hi>These signs shall follow them that believe.</hi> In my Name they shall cast out Devils, they shall speak with new Tongues, they shall take up Serpents, &amp;c. Which promise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth not to us, as <hi>those signs</hi> are not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected now: Must we therefore say, that was a mixt Covenant made with those Primitive belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, <hi>different from the Covenant of Grace</hi> we are under? Surely it is called the Covenant of Grace, from the <hi>main essential promises</hi> of Grace, and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: I say, it hath its Denomination from those Grand promises, which God made to his Church and People in <hi>all Ages;</hi> and which make it the same Covenant for substance, notwithstanding a difference, and change in certain accessions and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantials.</p>
               <p>So if it alledged, that the Old Testament doth more abound with Temporal promises.</p>
               <p>The Answer is ready, <hi>Magis &amp; Minus non va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant Speciem.</hi> More and Less shew different De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:34554:169"/>not different Kinds. Though the <hi>Jews</hi> had <hi>more of the Earth</hi> promised, and Christians <hi>more of the Spirit,</hi> this will only prove Christians under a better dispensation of the Covenant; it will not <hi>disprove</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> being under a Covenant of Grace, since besides their temporal, they had also spiritual Promises.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. Had the Covenant made with the <hi>Jews</hi> been a covenant of Grace, the same for substance with the Gospel covenant, then Christ should have been the <hi>Mediator</hi> of it; but <hi>Moses</hi> was the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator</hi> of that Covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Inasmuch as that Covenant made with the <hi>Jews,</hi> did admit of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> this sheweth it was not a covenant of works. The covenant of works hath no Mediator.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Moses</hi> as he was Mediator was a <hi>type</hi> of Christ, therefore Christ was the <hi>true Mediator,</hi> even then as well as now, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.8. <hi>Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.</hi> Indeed Christ is called the <hi>Mediator of a better Covenant,</hi> Heb. 8.6. Not wholly to exclude him from having to do in the former covenant, but because as the <hi>Law came</hi> by <hi>Moses,</hi> and he was made use of to report it from God to the <hi>Israelites, Acts</hi> 7.38. (in which respect he is called a Mediator, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19.) So the better covenant was delivered, the better dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of the covenant was set <hi>forth by Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> (as <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2.) as it was fit he should have the Honour of it. But as Remission of sin, and Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation unto God was <hi>attainable</hi> under the first covenant, so Christ was the Mediator then, and not <hi>Moses.</hi> Indeed, in all Ages Christ was both <hi>Prophet, Priest,</hi> and <hi>King</hi> to his Church; though he
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:34554:170"/>was not so clearly revealed in these his Offices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as he is to his People under the Gospel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 4. The Old Testament was dedicated with the blood of Beasts, not of Christ, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.18, 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The <hi>virtue of Christs blood</hi> did certainly extend to the times of the Old Testament. And was not that Blood, wherewith the first Testament was Dedicated, <hi>Typical</hi> of the blood of Christ? Now how absurd is it to talk of a Covenant of works <hi>typical</hi> of a Covenant of Grace, (as Mr. <hi>Patient,</hi> holds it is, who makes this Objection.) How strange were it, if a Covenant of works should be <hi>so Dedicated,</hi> as to represent Christ and his Benefits; which is the soul and substance of the Covenant of Grace. Indeed, as a Modern writer notes:

                  <hi>Object.</hi> But the Covenant which God made with the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Covenant made with Believers under the Gospel, are spoken of as <hi>two Covenants;</hi> one called the First, and the old Covenant; the other
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:34554:170"/>the New; and the second Covenant one said to have been <hi>faulty,</hi> the other called a <hi>better</hi> Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6, 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The terms Old, and New, First, and Second, will not prove them essentially Different, or different Kinds of Covenants; (nor were they, unless we restrain the Covenant made with the <hi>Jews,</hi> to that part of it, which was meerly <hi>political</hi>) but only various Dispensations of one and the same Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. In <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.1. We read of a Covenant made with the <hi>Israelites, besides the Covenant</hi> made with them in <hi>Horeb;</hi> not that these were two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants <hi>specifically different</hi> (as some have very groundlesly supposed) but the same Covenant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed.</p>
               <p>The Gospel-covenant is called <hi>a new Covenant;</hi> not but that the Covenant made with the <hi>Jews</hi> of old, was the same for substance, as otherwise <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> had not been of the <hi>Jews:</hi> But because though these were the same <hi>for substance,</hi> yet they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse in respect of Administration.
<note n="*" place="margin">Foedus novum non substantiâ, sed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mâ.</note> So a man is said to take a new <hi>Lease,</hi> or to enter into a new Bond, when the Former and the Latter are the same for substance. The same Law of Love is called both an Old and a New Commandment. That which is called the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<note place="margin">Spark. <hi>Myst. of Godliness.</hi> p. 64.</note> is not (as one says) a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant upon new conditions, but a New condition of the old Covenant. Or as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that which the Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly calls the Old Testament,
<note place="margin">Statham <hi>Reviler rebuked.</hi> p. 91.</note> or Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.20. was but the old Administration of the Covenant of Grace,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:34554:171"/>the <hi>old Copy</hi> of Christs will: That which it calls the new Covenant, is the old for substance, though new for the Administration, the <hi>new Copy</hi> of Christs will.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the <hi>first Covenant</hi> is supposed by the ensuing Alteration, not to have been faultless; the plain meaning seems to be, that it was a less <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Dispensation,</hi> than that in Gospel-times, not so clear, not so powerful, &amp;c. The Old Testament-dispensation was but as a first <hi>draught.</hi> We have the lively Representation of those things in the Gospel, which were more darkly <hi>shadowed</hi> out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1. The Old Testament was as a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,</hi> or Introduction to the New.</p>
               <p>Or else the Apostle calleth that the <hi>first Covenant,</hi> which the <hi>Jews</hi> then took to be the Covenant; to wit, the meer External part of it under the former Dispensation, which was but as the <hi>Shell</hi> or <hi>Husk;</hi> which yet the carnal <hi>Jews</hi> were most taken with, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the <hi>Kernel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Gospel-covenant is called a better Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, established upon better promises; because <hi>a better Dispensation</hi> of the Covenant, where there are clearer promises of Spiritual blessings, and which is fuller of such promises. Spiritual promises were more <hi>sparingly</hi> set down in the old Covenant. As was hinted before, it was most congruous, that Christ the Mediator of the Covenant, should have the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of bringing</hi> in the best dispensation of it. That the best Dispensation of the Covenant was defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, till the Mediators coming in Person.</p>
               <p>Or else the Gospel-covenant is called a <hi>better Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> comparing it with the covenant made with the <hi>Jews,</hi> onely so far as it was <hi>political,</hi> and a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:34554:171"/>dispensation given to them, which the far greater part of them <hi>sinfully fevered</hi> and divided from the Covenant of Grace, and stuck to, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the Gospel; which was an higher, and a better Dispensation of the Covenant of <hi>Grace.</hi>

One whom I mentioned a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Objecteth, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.59, 60, 61, 62. where God opposeth, <hi>Their Covenant</hi> to His <hi>Covenant.

Who would hence draw this wide and wild conclusion, that the Covenant made with the <hi>Jews,</hi> which God there calleth <hi>thy Covenant,</hi> was a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, quite opposite to that which He calleth <hi>[My Covenant]</hi> that is, the Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> But may we not think, that they are <hi>put to their shifts,</hi> that are forced to such Allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as have nothing like a Proof, or Argument.

                     <hi>Blake vind. Foed.</hi> p. 216.</note> As a Learned man observes, that Text hath been very much vexed, and wrested, several Parties would writh
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:34554:172"/>it to their several Opinions, and press it to serve se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral purposes. As the <hi>Antinomian</hi> would hence prove the covenant of Grace, to be <hi>absolute</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out condition, God promising to put his Law in their hearts. The <hi>Familists</hi> hence <hi>cry down</hi> the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, and Gospel-Ordinances; because it is said, they shall Teach <hi>no more,</hi> every man his Neighbour, and every man his Brother. (But these plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict themselves; and while they insist on the <hi>bare Letter</hi> of the Text, which if it be against Teaching by Man, it is more against <hi>Brother teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Brother,</hi> and Neighbour teaching Neighbour; (which is a thing they allow &amp; practise) than against the Teaching of <hi>men in Office;</hi> of which the Text saith nothing.) Others again urge this Text to prove, that only the <hi>regenerate are in covenant,</hi> and have a right to Church-priviledges, and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. To all which I may add one sort more: The <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> that hence conclude, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with the <hi>Jews,</hi> was not a <hi>covenant of Grace,</hi> and of Salvation; but a Covenant of Outward and Temporal Priviledges, or as the more Ignorant sort of them, a <hi>covenant of Works.</hi> And so Mr. <hi>Patient</hi> will have it. But, 1. If that Covenant made formerly with the <hi>Jews</hi> was a covenant of VVorks, not of Grace, then God was <hi>Married</hi> unto them by a <hi>covenant of Works:</hi> As <hi>ver.</hi> 32. he saith, He was an Husband unto them. But it is not to be imagined, that God should be Married unto sinners, by a covenant of VVorks. 2. That which is here called a <hi>New covenant,</hi> meaneth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a New dispensation of the Covenant, which should be at the Messiahs coming in Gospel-times. <hi>Called New,</hi> for the great change there should be
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:34554:173"/>for the better in manner of Administration, in which respect it might seem to be a <hi>New covenant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</hi> 3. The truth of this second particular will appear, if we consider what this New covenant is: [<hi>I will put my Law in their inward parts:</hi> &amp;c.] which is spoken <hi>comparate, non absolute.</hi> Not as if God had not done this for them before in some measure; but that he would do it in a <hi>further mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:</hi> [I will put my Law in their inwards parts.] This God had done for some of them before, as he had promised this before, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. There was some among them that could say as the Psalmist, <hi>Psal.</hi> 40.8. I delight to do thy will, O my God; yea, thy <hi>Law is within my heart.</hi> But that Grace which was more rare under the Old Testament, is promised to be extended to more, more plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>diffused</hi> under the New. And this is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of [I will make a New covenant— not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Covenant that I made with their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 8. That Covenant made with the <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites,</hi> they are said to <hi>have broken,</hi> Jer. 31.32. Ezek. 16.59. But it is impossible, that the New covenant lying wholly on Gods part, should be broken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This supposeth what is not to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, that the Covenant of Grace lieth <hi>wholly on Gods part,</hi> and nothing is required of man therein. But I have undeniably proved before, that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace hath <hi>Conditions,</hi> conditions not <hi>required of God,</hi> but of men: As 'tis not required of God, but of man to Believe, Repent, Obey, sincerely. And if any of us do not come up to <hi>these Terms,</hi> and Duties, whereunto we stand
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:34554:173"/>bound, we are guilty of breach of covenant. If God and Man be not mutually engaged; if all lieth wholly on Gods part, and Man is to do nothing, then it is an <hi>absolute Promise,</hi> not a Covenant.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Preston</hi> indeed speaks of a <hi>double Covenant,</hi> which cannot be broken,
<note place="margin">

But the <hi>Covenant properly with Man,</hi> that covenant, according to the terms and tenor where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we are to look for Remission and Salvation, is <hi>conditional;</hi> and in the tenders of it, common both to Elect and Reprobate. And as for all those that <hi>profess to own,</hi> and embrace the covenant, and yet come not up to the terms of it, they are guilty of breach of Covenant with God; and continuing such, shall be judged and condemned as <hi>covenant-breakers.</hi> VVhere the condition of the covenant ought to be performed, and is not, there (it is manifest) the covenant is broken.</p>
               <p>Yea, I do not question but Believers themselves are generally to be humbled for this sin, that they have broken <hi>covenant</hi> with God. They may have been guilty of breaking covenant with him for a time, who yet do not <hi>finally</hi> break covenant with him.</p>
               <p>Further, I would ask one that is of Mr. <hi>P</hi>'s per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion here (whether Anabaptist, or other) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all in their societies be not persons <hi>entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Covenant?</hi> And next, whether there be no Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites in their societies? And then, whether any Hypocrite, while an hypocrite, keepeth Covenant.</p>
               <pb n="338" facs="tcp:34554:174"/>
               <p>Certainly the Covenant that Christian Churches are taken into, which is <hi>sealed in Baptism,</hi> may be broken, and is broken by some, if there are any Hypocrites within the visible Church, that is, if the <hi>visible</hi> and <hi>invisible</hi> Church be not all one. It is as little to be doubted, that there are persons in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, who yet break it, and shall be judged as Violators of it; as that there are branches in Christ that bear not Fruit, and therefore shall be cut off, and taken away, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.2.</p>
               <p>Therefore they must search out some other mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these words, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.32. <hi>VVhich my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant they brake.</hi> And not make this a <hi>Note of Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi> betwixt the <hi>Covenant made with the Jews,</hi> and the <hi>Gospel-Covenant,</hi> that the former might be broken, not the latter. As to the Elect it is true, they do not <hi>totally and finally</hi> break Covenant; and that Grace enabling to keep the Covenant, is given out to a far greater Number than before; but we cannot say simply and absolutely, that the Gospel-covenant is never broken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 9. The Covenant of Grace never ceaseth, it is the everlasting Covenant, but the Covenant made with the <hi>Jews</hi> is <hi>vanished, Heb.</hi> 8.13. Now what is vanished away, cannot be the same with that which is to remain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. As <hi>Tena, Novum Testamentum non tam abolitio, quàm impletio prioris.</hi> The New Testament is not so much an abolishing, as a fulfilling of the Old. 2. Where the Apostle speaks of the Old Covenant, as that which was to <hi>vanish away,</hi> we are to understand it of that part of the covenant which was peculiar and proper to that Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The <hi>Ceremonial-Law</hi> given to the Jews, is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:34554:174"/>Circumcision is vanished, yet the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> (to which Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision then did appertain,) remaineth still the same for substance, which Believers are taken into. The <hi>Judicial Law</hi> which was given to the <hi>Jews,</hi> is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, so far as it did peculiarly respect their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth: but not the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> I hope, which the Lord hath promised to write in the hearts of his People. <hi>Do we make voyd the Law through Faith?

                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 10. If the covenant made with the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and the Gospel covenant, be <hi>one and the same for substance,</hi> how comes it to pass, that the Apostle so oft opposeth these <hi>two Covenants,</hi> as <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.24. &amp;c. why does he make the Law and Gospel, and works of the Law and Faith Opposites?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> That late writer, whom I had occasion to make use of before, (in the Answer to the Fourth Objection) distinguisheth of the <hi>Law given by Moses,</hi> thus (though not in these very words, yet to this sence) to wit,
<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>T. Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,</hi> &amp;c. p. 23. to 37.</note> That it is to be considered, either as respecting the <hi>Jewish Common-wealth,</hi> or as respecting Conscience; either in a <hi>Political</hi> or in a <hi>Spiritual</hi> sence. 1. As re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting the <hi>Jews</hi> common-wealth, so this was the <hi>Law of the Land,</hi> by which they were all to be
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:34554:175"/>governed, as a Common-wealth. And this Law was two-fold, to wit, 1. The strict <hi>Original Law,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting Obedience to all Gods commands, whether Moral, Judicial, or Ceremonial, <hi>upon pain of death;</hi> so a violent temporal Death was due to every one that failed in observing any external Precept of the Law. 2. The Remedying Law answering to it, which appointed a Sacrifice to be offered <hi>in most cases,</hi> upon which the Offendor and Transgressor was discharged from the aforesaid temporal Death threatned.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The same Law (that is, materially the same) is also to be considered, as respecting <hi>conscience.</hi> And here we are to take notice likewise, 1. The <hi>Original Law</hi> here was so wonderfully strict, and dreadfully severe, that it threatned an eternal curse, <hi>everlasting death,</hi> to any the least transgression whatsoever. As it had to do with Conscience, it threatned Death Eternal to every Sin, even to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward secret sins, in heart or thought; such things as it did not take notice of, or threaten with a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent temporal Death, as it was their <hi>Common-wealth Law.</hi> 2. The <hi>Remedying Law</hi> answering to it, and given with it, which was to this purpose, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they were, all of them, many wayes guilty of the breach of Gods most holy Law, and so <hi>obnoxious to the curse;</hi> yet such was his Grace, that upon their sincere Repentance, and real and hearty Endeavours to obey God in all things, their sins should be pardoned, and their Souls saved.</p>
               <p>Now taking the Law in this last sence, as it <hi>held forth pardon</hi> and salvation to sinners upon their hearty return to God, and sincere Obedience, so there is <hi>no Opposition</hi> betwixt this Remedying Law, and the Gospel. The Apostle speaking of it, calleth it <hi>the
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:34554:175"/>word of Faith,</hi> the same <hi>which we preach,</hi> Rom. 10.8. So it was the <hi>Salvation of the Jews,</hi> Joh. 4.22. the means of salvation to those that were saved.</p>
               <p>As it was their <hi>common-wealth</hi> Law, it typified higher things. First, in that it threatned every transgression with Death, it shewed the wonderfull strictness of Gods Law, as in an <hi>higher sence,</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning eternal Death to every sin. Again, as there was a Remedying Law, given with it, appointing in most cases, a Beast to be slain, to prevent the Death of the Offender, it was a <hi>typical Gospel,</hi> sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing out the Reconciliation of sinners by a more excellent Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>Again, there is another distinction I would have you take notice of, to wit, that we must distinguish betwixt the Law, <hi>as it was given by God,</hi> and as it was <hi>mistaken</hi> and <hi>perverted</hi> by many of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as the Law was given by God, we may be sure, as Mr. <hi>Allen</hi> hath well noted, <q>It was not to cross, or confront the Promise, or Gods design in it,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Discourse of the two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants,</hi> p. 55.</note> but to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient to it. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Is the Law then against the Promises?</hi> God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid. For it is not to be thought that God would prevaricate in his Design. So that when he had once made <hi>a new Law of Grace,</hi> for the saving of Fallen man, he would yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards give any Law, but what should one way or other subserve to the same end, if men do not deprive themselves of the intended Benefit, by perverting it. And therefore to be sure, God did not intend to revive the Old covenant of works made with <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="342" facs="tcp:34554:176"/>
               <p>Now to apply these things to our present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, when the Apostle makes an <hi>opposition</hi> betwixt the Old Testament and the New; the Law and the Gospel; the works of the Law, and Faith; we are either to understand him, as speaking of the Law, so far as it was <hi>political,</hi> concerning the <hi>Jews</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth: Thus indeed it made nothing perfect, it was but a <hi>shadow,</hi> and was to give place and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, the Substance being come: Or else he speaks of the Law in a strict sence, abstracted from those <hi>gracious Promises</hi> that were given with it to the <hi>Jews.</hi> And thus it was a copy of the <hi>Law of works,</hi> requiring absolute perfect Obedience.</p>
               <p>Thus it was opposite to the Gospel, as the <hi>Jews</hi> severed it from, and set it up against the Doctrine of Gods Grace; and so it <hi>gendred to bondage, Gal.</hi> 4.24. and was the Ministration of Death and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6, 7, 9. So there was no being justified by the Law; or if men could have been justified by it, they had not been justified by Grace, there had been nothing of Pardon in it.</p>
               <p>But otherwise the Apostle makes the Doctrine of the Old Testament all one with the Doctrine he preached, as we heard before.</p>
               <p>And if at any other time he useth any <hi>derogating expressions,</hi> when he is speaking of it, we must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand them as spoken <hi>comparatively,</hi> that is, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring that darker and more burdensome admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, with this clearer and more comfortable dispensation of the Covenant of Grace under the Gospel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> If you ask, how could the Law given to the <hi>Jews</hi> be considered both as a <hi>Law of works,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring perfect Obedience, and also as a <hi>Remedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:34554:176"/>Law,</hi> taking up with sincere Obedience?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Had the strict Original Law been given to them <hi>intentionally</hi> to bind them up to it, to expect Life and Happiness, onely upon those high terms of doing all things therein contained, and obeying perfectly; then had it been plainly <hi>exclusive</hi> of a remedying Law: But it was not given thus, but the very intention of publishing the strictness and severity of the Law of <hi>works</hi> (which all men natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally are under) was to commend and set forth the Graciousness of the <hi>Remedying Law,</hi> to make it more welcome and acceptable. How gladly and thankfully ought they to have submitted to that <hi>Law of Grace,</hi> which held forth pardon and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation with God, upon their believing in him, and obeying sincerely, of whom God might <hi>(in Justice)</hi> have required nothing less than perfect, sinless Obedience.</p>
               <p>And therefore it was a most horrible <hi>perverting</hi> of the Law, when the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and other self-justiciaries, expected Righteousness, and Life from the Law, <hi>in their sence,</hi> and in opposition to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, For, 1. As it was the <hi>Law of the Land,</hi> as it respected their Common-wealth, so (it is true) it was possible for them to keep the Law, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6. They might not be guilty of any such <hi>external breach</hi> of the Law, as legally deserved a violent temporal death, and such as could not be <hi>expiated by Sacrifice,</hi> but all this could not justifie them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. As it was their Common-wealth Law, it was never given for that end; but to keep them in order, and to shadow out greater and higher things.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As it held forth the strict Law of works, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:34554:177"/>perfect sinless Obedience, so they could not possibly keep it, to <hi>be justified by it;</hi> but were all transgressors of the Law, and so condemned by it; which should have moved them to embrace, and submit to it in a <hi>Gospel-sence.</hi> And in keeping the Law sincerely, heartily bewailing the sinfull defects in their Obedience, and having recourse to the free grace and mercy of God for pardon, they might have found acceptance, and an exceeding great reward.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 11. If the old Covenant was a Covenant of Grace, then why are the <hi>Jews</hi> said to have been in <hi>bondage</hi> under it? why is the Spirit of Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on restrained to the time of the New Testament, if the former was the same Covenant of Grace, (for substance) with the latter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. One way how the former Covenant gendred unto bondage, was hinted before; to wit, <hi>carnal Jews,</hi> (men of base, servile Spirits) did mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpret, and misapply it. 2. The faithfull under that dispensation might in another respect be said to be <hi>in bondage, Gal.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3. As they were under a more <hi>burdensome way</hi> of Worship, than Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers under the Gospel. As they had not so much liberty, nor so much of a Spirit of Adoption, as the faithfull have under the Gospel. As some, <q>The Church at that time was as an Heir in its minority.

                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 12. You will not deny but the Covenant made with the <hi>Israelites,</hi> may be considered <hi>as Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical,</hi> and why might it not be only or meerly <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The highest, most noble, and <hi>primary</hi> end of the Law given to <hi>Israel,</hi> and the Covenant made with them, seems to be to direct, and engage them in the way to Life and Happiness. That it was but a <hi>secondary,</hi> and less <hi>principal</hi> use, or end of it, to govern them, as a <hi>Theocracy,</hi> or holy Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As the <hi>Covenants,</hi> and <hi>giving of the Law</hi> are set down among the <hi>Jews</hi> Priviledges, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. <hi>Psal.</hi> 147.19, 20. yet the giving of the Law was nothing near so great a Priviledge, taken in the <hi>temporal sence,</hi> (respecting their Common-wealth; as it was in that higher Notion, and consideration,) as it was to <hi>convert the Soul,</hi> and to direct in the way to true and eternal Happiness.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I should think, that the <hi>Israelites</hi> covenanting with God, did oblige them to keep his Law, not only as it was the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> Law, and for fear of temporal punishment, and in hope of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent temporal Reward, but from a <hi>filial fear,</hi> and <hi>love of God,</hi> in sincerity and truth, the thing requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Covenant of Grace, <hi>sc. Deut.</hi> 5.29. and 10, 12, 13. <hi>Heart-obedience</hi> was required in that Covenant made with the <hi>Jews.</hi>

So also <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.12,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:34554:178"/>13. <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.4. But this was proved before, that the Covenant made with the <hi>Israelites</hi> was a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, the same for substance with the Gospel-covenant; therefore not <hi>meerly politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</hi>

               <p>Now this point having been sufficiently cleared, That the Covenant of Grace is one and the same for substance, under the Old and New Testament; it may be of good use.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ʋse</hi> 1. This shews us how the Church is One. There is one catholick Church, consisting of divers parts, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.9. <hi>My Dove, my Ʋndefiled is but one.</hi> There is <hi>one Body,</hi> as <hi>one Spirit, one hope of our calling, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptisme,</hi> Eph. 4.4, 5. One <hi>Church-catholick,</hi> constituted by one <hi>Grand Charter,</hi> or Covenant of Grace, (though it's true, the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> had a special clause in their Grant and Charter concerning them as a Common-wealth, which is not in the Christians charter.) So the Ordinances and Priviledges of the Church are given and granted by <hi>this Charter,</hi> to the whole Church <hi>primarily,</hi> and to particular Churches <hi>consequently</hi> and <hi>secondarily,</hi> as parts of it.</p>
               <p>And methinks it is very rational, what some have offered, that it is <hi>occasional,</hi> and <hi>accidental</hi> to the Universal Church,
<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hudson.</hi>
                  </note> that there are particular distinct Congregations, in regard of the <hi>multitude</hi> and distance of Church-members; for could we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that all the Members of the whole Church could meet together, to partake of the same <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical Ordinances</hi> orderly and to Edification, then the reason for their meeting in several places should
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:34554:178"/>cease. <hi>David</hi> would praise God in the <hi>great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,</hi> among much People. And the more publick the Assembly is <hi>(Caeteris paribus)</hi> other things being alike, the more solemn the Worship is, the more for Gods Glory, and his Peoples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, quickning, and comfort. (Though it is true, sometimes Gods People have not had the Liberty to <hi>meet openly,</hi> when the Church was to be sought:

                  <hi>Non in tectis, &amp; exteriori pompâ, sed potius in carceribus, &amp; speluncis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some good men I know will not admit there is such a thing, as an <hi>Ʋniversal visible Church,</hi> for fear of bringing in the <hi>Pope,</hi> or an <hi>Ʋniversal visible Head of the Church,</hi> though this no way follows upon the other. But however Good men may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in such Points here; yet when they meet at last in that <hi>General Assembly,</hi> spoken of, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23. There shall be no <hi>Dissenters</hi> then among them. In the mean time I would ask, What Church that was to which so many Souls were added, even Three Thousand in one day? <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41, 47. See also <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.4. and 5. and 14. Could it be a <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Congregation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>what Church</hi> that was, wherein God set Apostles, Prophets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. Were the Apostles set <hi>in particular</hi> Churches? Or were they not <hi>general Officers</hi> unto, and over the whole Church?</p>
               <p>And what Church does Baptism declare, and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie ones admission into? Is it only a sign of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission into a <hi>particular Church?</hi> Suppose a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster cast among a company of Heathen, and one, or more converted by him, should not such be <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized</hi>
                  <pb n="348" facs="tcp:34554:179"/>upon the Profession of the Faith of Christ, though there was no <hi>particular Church</hi> constituted there, into whose Fellowship they might be taken?</p>
               <p n="2">2. This may serve as an Antidote, against the Error of the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> who <hi>to out the children</hi> of professing Parents of their Interest in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, would fain perswade men, that the <hi>Covenant made with the Jews</hi> (wherein children were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended with their Parents) was not the same for substance; but quite of another kind. Now since we have proved <hi>the Old and New Covenant,</hi> the same Covenant of Grace for substance; their Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is shaken, and so what they would build upon it, not like to stand. If children were <hi>capable of being in covenant</hi> with God, with their Parents heretofore, why not now? Either they must say, our children are <hi>more incapable</hi> of a covenant Interest in God, than the children of the <hi>Jews;</hi> or that God is <hi>less Merciful,</hi> bears less respect to the children of his People now, than he did to the children of the <hi>Jews:</hi> Both which are <hi>loaded with absurdity.</hi> But more of this afterwards.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This may help to keep up in us a reverent, and high esteem of the Scriptures <hi>of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> Wise men would not throw away their old <hi>Evidences.</hi> What you have heard, may let you see an <hi>Harmony</hi> betwixt the Old and New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Yea, Christians though they are not to keep up Jewish ceremonies; yet they may make better use of the Ceremonial Law, than the <hi>Jews</hi> ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily did, who rested in the Letter of the Law, and were taken up with the outward shadows, <hi>not look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the end</hi> of that which is Abolished. We may see the <hi>End,</hi> and <hi>Scope</hi> of the Ceremonial Law
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:34554:179"/>more clearly, than the <hi>Jews</hi> themselves did, having so fair and <hi>plain a Comment</hi> upon it in the Gospel: As Prophecies are best Interpreted by their accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment; so Types by the coming of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type, and comparing them together.</p>
               <p>There are some that slight, and reject the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Old Testament. This they never <hi>learnt</hi> of Christ, or his Apostles. We find Christ Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets to his Disciples <hi>even after his Resurrection,</hi> Luke 24.27. And are those Scriptures unworthy of a Christians perusal, which Christ thought not unworthy of his <hi>Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</hi> The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Whatsoever things were written aforetime, were written for our Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Rom. 15.4. And all Scripture given by Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God, is profitable, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. He Vindicates his Doctrine, and confirms it from the <hi>Scriptures of the Old Testament,</hi> Acts 26.22, 23. And we find the <hi>Bereans</hi> commended for their searching those Scriptures, and <hi>trying Doctrines</hi> by them, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11. The Doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets, (as we learn, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.20.) are one <hi>Foundation</hi> of Faith. Christians are there said to be built <hi>upon the Foundation</hi> (not Foundations) of the Apostles and Prophets. That to take away the Scriptures of the Old Testament, is to take away <hi>part of the Foundation.</hi> We have a more sure word of Prophecy, (says the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi>) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto ye do well, that ye take heed, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This may further confirm us in the belief of the Gospel. That it is no <hi>new Doctrine,</hi> but the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of it was held forth of old by <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Prophets; upon which account there is <hi>less Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> to suspect the truth of it. The main Doctrine
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:34554:180"/>of the Gospel is non other, than what God hath Owned, and Delivered to his <hi>Church of old,</hi> Acts 26.22. <hi>Antiquity</hi> is a thing which many would pretend to follow. Well, this is the antient Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel: And it is proved to be of God; as by the <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought to confirm it, with other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; so by the <hi>writings of Moses</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>John</hi> 5.46. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.24. It hath double con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation. We have <hi>old Evidences</hi> to shew for it, to make it good. As God spake by the Mouth of his holy Prophets, which have been since the world began, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.70.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Hence we may see cause to admire Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious dealing with us, under the <hi>Gospel-Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Covenant. The <hi>Jews</hi> were highly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, in being taken into that Covenant God made with them; though it was a <hi>darker Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Covenant of Grace. Now God hath done more for us, than he did for that his antiently-beloved People, taking us into <hi>the same</hi> Covenant for substance, (it is true, but) in a clearer, a <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Dispensation</hi> of it. Many Kings and Prophets, and Righteous men among them, desired to see the things which we see, yet did not see them. The <hi>Jews</hi> heretofore were <hi>priviledged above</hi> any Nation in the world; yet we are priviledged above them: we that live in Gospel-times, we have the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, in the last and <hi>best Edition</hi> of it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This shews what ground Christians have to apply Old Testament Promises, such as are of a <hi>common concern:</hi> as the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> tells them, they should be no loosers by submitting to the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39. <hi>Repent and be Baptized.— For the Promise is to you, and to your children;</hi> and
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:34554:180"/>(not only to you <hi>Jews,</hi> by Birth or Profession, but) <hi>to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.</hi> VVhat ever promises are included in that <hi>[I will be their God;]</hi> and belong unto it, to make it good, the Covenant being the <hi>same for substance</hi> in both Testaments; such promises, though found in the Old Testament do also belong to the Faithful under the New. See an Instance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Be content with such as you have: For he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake thee.</hi> VVhere hath he said this? See <hi>Josh.</hi> 1.5. or <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.8. So the like Instance you have, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.6. So that <hi>we may boldly</hi> say, The Lord is my Helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me. <hi>Ʋpon what ground</hi> may we say thus? VVhy in as much as the Psalmist could say thus, <hi>Psal.</hi> 118.6. VVe who have an Interest in God, as well as he, may say the like.</p>

               <p>I Gnorance of, or not attending to this Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is a cause of very grosse Mistakes; as may be seen in that Pitiful, Loose Discourse of Mr. <hi>Patients,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>Some Distinguish betwixt an <hi>Outward,</hi> and an <hi>Inward</hi> Covenant; but that seemeth to be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great Inconveniencies. Neither may we think, that God hath made with Men a Covenant, which containeth only outward Priviledges, upon the condition of an outward visible Profession; that he hath made any such Covenant, <hi>distinct</hi> from that which is called the Inward Covenant, that holds forth Pardon, Justification, and Salvation, upon Souls return to God, and hearty acceptance of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ. One that sometime useth this <hi>distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>

                     <hi>Blakes Covenant sealed.</hi> p. 125.</note> yet expresseth his meaning thus. <q>The Covenant is but one and the same, but all are not <hi>in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> after <hi>one and the same</hi> manner. Some are only in it by outward Profession, to the present participation of <hi>outward Priviledges;</hi> but some by cordial acceptance, to the enjoyment of saving Benefits.</q> Therefore it is much safer and clearer,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:34554:181"/>to <hi>distinguish of the manner</hi> of mens being in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which is different; as some are only out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in Covenant, others also inwardly. <hi>Then to distinguish</hi> of the <hi>Covenant</hi> as either outward, or inward. As Mr. <hi>Ball,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Of the Covenant,</hi> p. 24. <hi>where you may see more to this purpose. As also,</hi> p. 202, 203.</note>
                  <q>Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally this Covenant is made with every Member of the Church,— but Savingly, <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually,</hi> and Special manner it is made only with them, who are partakers of the Benefits promised.</q>
               </p>
               <p>They that are only <hi>Externally</hi> in Covenant, bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enter into Covenant, and do not stand to, or continue in it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.9. <hi>They continued not in my Covenant, and I regarded them not.</hi> Which yet (by the way) <hi>implieth,</hi> that the Covenant before made with the <hi>Jews,</hi> was a Covenant of Grace; which if they had observed according to the <hi>true Tenour</hi> of it, God would then have accepted them, and would have had a Gracious regard to them. They that are <hi>Inwardly</hi> in Covenant, are such as <hi>heartily close</hi> with Gods Terms, and have his Laws written in their hearts, and have a right to the Inward, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, Saving Benefits; and Blessings of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
               <p>That there are these <hi>two wayes</hi> of being in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, is a thing so plain, as methinks I need not spend many words to prove it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a <hi>Two-fold manner of being in Christ,</hi> and therefore a twofold manner of being in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. For all that are in Christ, are in Covenant. Now some are in Christ <hi>only Externally,</hi> such as are to be taken away: Others also <hi>Internally,</hi> such as shall for ever abide in him. There are Fruitless
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:34554:182"/>branches, and there are Fruit-bearing branches, <hi>John</hi> 15.2.6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All <hi>that are called,</hi> are within the Church, and within the Covenant. Now some are called only Externally, others are also called Effectually: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more are called Externally than are chosen ones, called Internally and Effectually, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.16. and 22.14.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They that are Sanctified by the Blood of the Covenant, must needs be supposed in some sence <hi>within the Covenant.</hi> Now the Apostle supposeth of some, who were Sanctified by the Blood of the Covenant, that they may be guilty of <hi>treading un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot</hi> the Son of God, and doing despite to the Spirit of Grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. Now such as he there speaks of, were never <hi>real Saints,</hi> never <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally</hi> in Covenant. They were Sanctified: How? Not Internally, but Externally, in being seperated from the world of Heathens, visible Saints; called out of the World, and devoted to God, and his Service.</p>
               <p n="4">4. All that are <hi>within the Visible Church,</hi> are in Covenant, as <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.12. Aliens from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of <hi>Israel,</hi> and strangers to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Promise, were all one; so <hi>Vice versâ,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Church, and within the Covenant. But all within the Visible Church are not <hi>Internally</hi> in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. Otherwise you must hold, there are no Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, no Graceless, Unconverted persons with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Church. Certainly, we have no ground to think, that all within the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> or other Churches, we read of in the New Testament, were <hi>true Believers,</hi> real Saints. No doubt, with many of them, as of the <hi>Israelites</hi> of Old, God
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:34554:182"/>was not well pleased. They would be in Heaven before the time, that look for a Church consisting of none but <hi>real Saints.</hi> I wonder how or when that Scripture was, or will be fulfilled, [<hi>Isa.</hi> 19.25. <hi>Blessed be</hi> Egypt <hi>my People, and</hi> Assyria <hi>the work of my Hands, and</hi> Israel <hi>mine Inheritance.</hi>] If there are not some <hi>outwardly in Covenant,</hi> and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God by an outward Profession, who yet are not Gods People by a real and <hi>hearty Resignation</hi> of of themselves to him. If the Church admit not of some, who are Christians only outwardly, and the People of God by External profession, then <hi>Egypt, Assyria, Israel;</hi> yea, all the Kingdoms of the World at some time or other, have been, or shall be, all true Believers, and <hi>real Saints,</hi> see <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15. For the Scripture cannot be broken, <hi>John</hi> 10.35. The Word of God <hi>cannot</hi> fail.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object. Rom.</hi> 9.6, 7, 8. They are not all <hi>Israel,</hi> which are of <hi>Israel.</hi>— These which are the <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Flesh,</hi> these are not the Children of God: But the Children of the Promise are counted for the Seed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Some urge this against the Children of professing Christians, being in the Covenant. Hence they conclude, that the <hi>Natural Seed,</hi> as such, hath no priviledge under the Gospel.</p>
               <p>But, 2. If it determines against the Children of Believers being in Covenant, it determines against any being within the Covenant, but such as are the Children of God by Faith; the Children of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But indeed, both these are quite <hi>besides the scope</hi> of the place, which is this: The Apostle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to speake of the Rejection of the <hi>Jews,</hi> for their
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:34554:183"/>open Rejection of Christ and the Gospel, shews how such a thing might stand <hi>with Gods truth.</hi> Though he had promised to be the God of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and of his Seed; yet his Seed were either his <hi>Natural</hi> seed, or his <hi>Spiritual</hi> seed, or Seed by <hi>Analogy.</hi> Such as were meerly his <hi>Natural</hi> seed, might be cast off: <hi>They continued not in my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord,</hi> Heb. 8.9. This we see verified in <hi>Ishmael,</hi> and <hi>Esau:</hi> But as for such as were also his <hi>Spiritual</hi> seed, Children of the Promise, not only in that larger sence, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.25. But in a stricter sence, as here, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. Gods Covenant stood fast with them. And that Grace which others had offered to them, but wickedly rejected, these willingly embraced, and were blessed in. Besides that <hi>common Election</hi> of the Jewish Nation, whereby they were chosen and separated from among other Nations; there was also a <hi>Special Election</hi> of some of them from among the rest. And these God did not <hi>cast away, Rom.</hi> 11.1, 2, 5. These obtained that Grace and Mercy, which the rest missed of. So the Apostle sheweth, that while the generality of the Jewish Nation for their Infidelity, were to be <hi>Rejected,</hi> God would yet continue his Covenant with the Elect among them; and with the believing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Analogy,</hi> who were to be graffed into the like Covenant-state from whence the other were broken off, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17, 19. So the Apostles intent is to deny to the <hi>Natural</hi> seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that which was the Priviledge of the <hi>Spiritual seed</hi> only, (not to deny to the Spiritual seed such Priviledge as was even common to the <hi>Natural seed,</hi>) so likewise in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29. the
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:34554:183"/>Question the Apostle speaks to here, is not whether only true Believers are in Covenant, or whether the Parents being in Covenant, their Children are not in Covenant with them; but rather, whether they that are only Externally in Covenant, may not be broken off.</p>
               <p>Now to shew the Use of this Distinction of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Externally</hi> in Covenant, and of a being also In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally in Covenant:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hold to this Distinction, and you will easily Answer what some urge with great <hi>Vehemence,</hi> and Confidence against the <hi>Jews,</hi> having been under a Covenant of Grace. Because it is said, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.4. <hi>The Lord had not given</hi> them <hi>an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear.</hi> But this was necessary only to their being <hi>Internally</hi> in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, not to their being Externally in Covenant. Whereas some suppose it a strange absurdity, to say, God entered into a Covenant of Grace with them, to whom he had not given an heart to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is no more than to say, All who are <hi>Externally</hi> in Covenant, have not an heart to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, an heart to Repent, do not come up to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-terms. It is no more than to say, that all who are called <hi>Externally,</hi> are not called Inwardly and Effectually. No more than to say, that there Saints now by an <hi>External separation,</hi> and Visible profession, who are not Saints by a Spiritual Reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation And as <hi>heretofore</hi> there was a <hi>Seed, after the Flesh,</hi> and a <hi>Seed after the Spirit,</hi> even so now.</p>
               <p>Again, whereas the same Persons tell us, that if the Children of Believers be in the <hi>same Covenant</hi> with Believers, then they must all certainly <hi>be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi>
                  <pb n="358" facs="tcp:34554:184"/>as he that believeth, shall be Saved. This will not follow. Though indeed I see no reason, or ground to doubt of the <hi>Salvation</hi> of the Children of Believers; such as die in their Infancy, while they are <hi>pure Appendices</hi> of their Parents, when actual Faith and Repentance, is not required of them, while they have no will of their own; the Parents will and act, stands for their will and act. It would seem that <hi>in what sence</hi> God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be the God of believers, he hath also pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to be the God of their Seed, while they are to be looked on purely as their Seed; for so they are Interested in the Covenant upon the Parents ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, without any thing more required of them. But now the Covenant made with believers and their seed, hath such and such <hi>Conditions,</hi> required of all that are of Age, and not naturally uncapable of performing the same. Now supposing a true believer to <hi>fall from the condition,</hi> i. e. That he ceaseth to be a believer; it would certainly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the Covenant of Grace would cease to <hi>justifie him,</hi> that he should not be saved. So the Children of believers, if as they grow up, they do not come up to Covenant-Terms; that Covenant that would have justified them, dying Infants, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring no more of them at that Age, than what might have been <hi>pleaded</hi> for them; yet that same Covenant will condemn them as Violaters of it. And if when they are of capacity, they do not <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi> the <hi>condition</hi> which is then required of them in their own persons, with prophane <hi>Esau,</hi> they Sell their <hi>birth-right,</hi> and cut off all claim to the special benefits and blessings of the Covenant, by their own Act and Deed.</p>
               <pb n="359" facs="tcp:34554:184"/>
               <p>If I have been mistaken in what is here said of the salvation of believers Children, that die in their Infancy; yet I can say, I desire to Learn, and am willing to see my mistakes. But though I know not, that the Scripture, which affirmeth, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.2. That we are all <hi>Children of wrath</hi> by Nature, doth any where hold forth the Salvation of all that die in Infancy; which to <hi>assert,</hi> would seem to <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,</hi> that Gods destroying the old World, and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> &amp;c. were eminent Acts of <hi>Mercy,</hi> rather than of <hi>Justice,</hi> where in such multitudes of souls were sent to Heaven together; who if they had lived, had probably (at least, for the <hi>greatest part</hi> of them) gone to Hell. And how it may be Reconciled with that Reason, God giveth the angry Prophet, for his sparing <hi>Nineveh, Jon.</hi> 4.11. That there were more than Sixscore Thousand persons that could <hi>not discern betwixt the Right hand and the Left,</hi> I am not able to discern; if these (supposing <hi>Ninevehs</hi> Destruction, and their Fall <hi>in the Ruine of it</hi>) had all then been certainly saved, and not one of many of them (probably) saved, their Lives (with the rest of the City) <hi>being spared.</hi> Yet methinks it should be granted, that there is more hope of the Salvation of the Infants of believers, than of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans. Now that there is so, it must be because of their Interest in the Covenant, There were no more hope of the Salvation of the one, than of the other, if they were both alike Interested in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That there is a being only <hi>Externally</hi> in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as well as a being <hi>Internally:</hi> This would teach us not to expect a Church upon Earth, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Constituted, or consisting only of Real Saints. Certainly, all whom the Apostles themselves Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:34554:185"/>and admitted into Christian Fellowship, and Communion, were not <hi>true Converts,</hi> or real Saints. And when Three Thousand were admitted, all in one day (as in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.) how was it probable, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed possible, to take a particular account of each one, touching a <hi>work of Grace,</hi> and to enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the soundness of their Conversion. The Visible Church is a Field that hath <hi>Tares,</hi> as well as <hi>Wheat.</hi> It's not to be expected, that <hi>all the Tares,</hi> should be gathered out, till the end of the World. Then it is, that the Son of man should send forth his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and they shall gather out of his Kingdom all things that offend, and them which do Iniquity, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.40, 41. That such are said to be gathered out <hi>of his Kingdom</hi> then, it implieth there are, and will be such in his Kingdom till then. Again, <hi>ver.</hi> 47. The Kingdom of Heaven is compared to a <hi>Draw-net,</hi> which here encloseth Fish, both good and bad; and I would fain know, what Church we may find in all the New Testament, that was constituted by the Apostles themselves, all whose Members were to have been accounted <hi>real Saints,</hi> such as had true saving Grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That there are some only Externally in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, and not Internally; this should teach and <hi>warn us,</hi> not to rest in the former. As <hi>John Baptist</hi> said to them. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Think not within your selves, we have Abraham to our Father:</hi> So, think it not enough, to have been born of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Parents, or that you have <hi>been Baptized,</hi> or that you are Gods People by External profession; but walk in the steps of the Faithful, and as you have given up your Names, so give up <hi>your selves</hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o Christ. As I may allude to that of the Apostle,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:34554:185"/>
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29. He is not a Christian, who is so only <hi>outwardly,</hi> neither is that Baptism, which is only an outward washing of the Flesh: But he is a Christian indeed, who is so <hi>inwardly,</hi> and that is Baptism indeed, where the heart is cleansed, and where there is the answer of a good Conscience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God. And the Covenant of Grace may well be compared to <hi>Noahs Ark;</hi> as it was not hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the outside of the Ark, that would have sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved any of the Old World, but getting within the Ark, as <hi>Noah</hi> did. So our being Externally in Covenant with God will not avail to our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, unless we are also Internally in Covenant, coming up to Covenant-Terms. There are Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Kingdom, that shall be cast out.</p>

                  <hi>PROP. XVI.</hi> They that are only Externally in Covenant, yet are priviledged far above those who are strangers as to the Covenant.</head>
               <p>COvenant-Priviledges are not like the Common benefits of the Sun and Rain; but are Special and Distinguishing Favours. As was said of <hi>Israel</hi> of Old, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.7. <hi>What Nation so great, who hath God so nigh unto them?</hi> It must needs be a great Dignity and priviledge to be a <hi>People near unto the Lord.</hi> A great priviledge for People to have the Tabernacle of God with them. The Ark, where were the <hi>Tables of the Covenant,</hi> was <hi>Israels glory.</hi> The Apostle makes this, the chief priviledge of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that unto them were committed the <hi>Oracles of God.</hi> The Word is a Treasure to be chosen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thousands of Gold and Silver: This is a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure highly to be valued, though brought to us in <hi>earthen Vessels.</hi> The Word and Ordinances are choice Priviledges, belonging to those who are in
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:34554:186"/>Covenant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. It's a greater mercy to have thy <hi>spiritual Manna,</hi> than to have the greatest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Corn and Wine. Better is the Fatness of Gods House than the precious Fruits of the Earth. How much better are the Rivers of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure that run there, than Rivers of Oyl? Yea, the <hi>gleanings</hi> of Gods <hi>holy Hill,</hi> is better than the Earths Vintage. As the Soul is of more worth than the Body, so are <hi>means of Grace</hi> to be prized a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Means of outward Subsistence.</p>
               <p>As Gods Oracles and Ordinances belong to those that are in Covenant, so that choyce part of the Word, <hi>The Promises.</hi> Children of the Covenant, are Children of the Promises, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. To all within the Covenant the Promise of Salvation is offered, though but <hi>conditionally,</hi> yet sincerely. And if we fall short, the fault is onely in our selves.</p>
               <p>But the greatness of these Covenant-priviledges will appear in the sad and deplorable Estate of those that want, or are deprived of them. See what it is for men to be strangers to the Covenant, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. Such are said to be <hi>without Christ, without hope,</hi> and <hi>without God in the World.</hi> How dolefull is their condition, who can never hear the <hi>joyfull sound.</hi> To want the ordinary <hi>Means of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> is a want indeed: Ordinarily, <hi>Extra Ecclesiam non est salus,</hi> Acts 2.47. <hi>Where no Vision is, there the people perish.</hi> Such sit in Darkness, and in the Region and shadow of Death.</p>
               <p>How miserable was the state of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they were unchurched, when God called them <hi>Lo-ammi,</hi> would no longer own them as a people in Covenant with him. Then <hi>wrath</hi> is said to have
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:34554:187"/>
                  <hi>come upon them to the uttermost.</hi> It made the Apostle sad at heart to think of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p>Now what is said of the Priviledges of those who are but so much as <hi>externally</hi> in Covenant with God, should <hi>quicken us to Duty,</hi> not breed, or nourish security. The greater our Mercies, the greater our Engagements. The higher our <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,</hi> the greater Gods <hi>Expectations. Isa.</hi> 5.4. <hi>What could have been done more to my Vineyard, that I have not done in it? Wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth Grapes, brought it forth wild Grapes?</hi> To be lifted up to Heaven (with <hi>Capernaum</hi>) and not into Heaven, will oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion our greater down-fall, and sink us deeper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell.</p>

                  <hi>PROP. XVII.</hi> Besides those personal Benefits and Advantages accruing to men in Covenant, there is this comfortable priviledge also <hi>concerning their Seed,</hi> that they are involved and taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Covenant together with the Parents. As this is the Tenour of the Covenant, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy Seed.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>NOw to clear this, observe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. This hath been Gods Way and Manner all along, when he hath taken Parents into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, to <hi>take in their seed</hi> with them. You shall not find, that ever heretofore God entred into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with those that were Parents, <hi>singly</hi> by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, excluding their seed.</p>
               <p>The Covenant <hi>of Works</hi> was made with <hi>Adam</hi> for himself and his Posterity, I suppose that will be readily granted. And when the Covenant of works <hi>was broken</hi> on mans part, that there was no possibility of attaining Happiness that way, God made another Covenant <hi>with our</hi> first Parents, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising Salvation by the <hi>Seed of the Woman,</hi> that is,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:34554:188"/>Jesus Christ, who was to be born of a Virgin, which was the <hi>first Edition</hi> of the Covenant of Grace, as I shewed before.</p>
               <p>And here the seed of <hi>Adam</hi> were not excluded, but included; till such time as any of them cut off themselves from Gods Covenant by their own <hi>Act and Deed.</hi> Who are we to understand by the <hi>Sons of God,</hi> spoken of <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.2. but the seed of godly Parents, such as were descended from <hi>Seth, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch, &amp;c.</hi> who are called the <hi>Sons of God,</hi> not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they were his Creatures? for so they should not have been opposed to the <hi>Daughters of men,</hi> as there they are. <hi>Have not all one Father? Hath not one God created us?</hi> Mal. 2.10. Nor are they called the <hi>Sons of God,</hi> as being regenerated, and made <hi>new Creatures:</hi> For no such thing appears in the Context, but rather the contrary. But they are called the <hi>Sons of God</hi> as the <hi>Israelites</hi> are called the <hi>children of the Lord their God,</hi> Deut. 14.1. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within the Church, and in Covenant-relation to God.
<note place="margin">Vid <hi>Ayns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth.</hi>
                  </note> As by the <hi>Daughters of men</hi> there, are understood such as were of wicked <hi>Cains</hi> cursed posterity, such as were without the Church.</p>
               <p>Again, when God took <hi>Abraham</hi> into Covenant, his Seed were taken in with him.</p>
               <p>This is evident, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. so God owneth the Children of the <hi>Jews</hi> for his Children, his <hi>Sons and Daughters,</hi> Deut. 32.19. with <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.20. Yea, observe, the Church in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family consisted most of strangers, yet their children must all be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised, even such as (in the opinion of our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posites) were to have <hi>no Lot</hi> or <hi>part</hi> in the Land of <hi>Canaan, Gen.</hi> 17.12, 13. So the children of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:34554:188"/>that joyned themselves to the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> were taken into Covenant with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
               <p>Thus it was from the Beginning, that Children were taken into Covenant with their Parents. And why should it <hi>seem strange</hi> to any, that they should be taken in now?</p>
               <p n="1">(1) I would know of any man, if Children were capable of being taken into the Covenant of <hi>works</hi> with <hi>Adam,</hi> what makes them uncapable of being taken into a Covenant <hi>of Grace</hi> with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents now? And if children are capable of deriving Original corruption from their Parents, together with those manifold miseries that attend it, why are they uncapable of Covenant-priviledges, to be conveyed from Parents, taken into a Covenant of Grace? May we think, God's <hi>Justice</hi> is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous in the Covenant of Works, than his <hi>Grace</hi> is in the Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) If the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Covenant made with the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> was the <hi>same for substance</hi> with the Gospel-Covenant, and the seed then was taken in with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, what should exclude the seed of Believers now?</p>
               <p n="3">(3) Why should it seem strange, that God accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Act of the Parent to enter his child into Covenant, <hi>for the Act</hi> of the child, so long as the child is at its Parents dispose, and the Parent can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not truly and <hi>heartily devote</hi> himself to God, and his service, without being willing to <hi>devote all that is his</hi> to Gods service? Why should it <hi>seem strange,</hi> that here God accepteth the will of the Parent for the will of the child, till it comes <hi>by its own will</hi>
                  <pb n="368" facs="tcp:34554:189"/>to cross and revoke what the Parent had done for it?</p>
               <p>And here methinks, no <hi>Anabaptist,</hi> but if he be serious, instead of opposing our Doctrine of <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Interest</hi> in the Covenant with Parents, so hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and earnestly as they are wont, should so far en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to it, as to <hi>wish it true,</hi> and be willing to hear all that may be brought to prove it, and desire to see it cleared, both for their own comfort, and their childrens benefit. What a strange thing it were, if a godly man should not desire, and account it a <hi>great priviledge,</hi> to have his children in Covenant-relation to God? and that one who hath <hi>truely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted</hi> himself to God, should not desire by all means possible to engage his to God too?</p>
               <p>Now what is already said, maketh it at least <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,</hi> that children are taken into Covenant with their Parents still; they were taken in of Old, and the Covenants are the <hi>same for substance,</hi> and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens capacity the same, that except God bear less respect to <hi>his People and their seed now,</hi> than here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, they have the same priviledge of being in Covenant together with their Parents, as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>Indeed what was noted before of <hi>Proselytes and their seed</hi> being taken within the Covenant, proves it was not any <hi>specialty,</hi> peculiarly belonging to <hi>Abrahams</hi> Natural seed. Yea, was it not <hi>a figure</hi> of, or a <hi>Praeludium</hi> unto the calling of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> A fore-runner of that which is foretold, <hi>Isa.</hi> 49.22. <hi>I will lift mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the People, and they shall bring thy Sons in their Arms, and their Daughters shall be carryed upon their shoulders.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="369" facs="tcp:34554:189"/>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas our Opposites cannot deny, but children were in Covenant together with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents under the former dispensation, they can never prove <hi>Children excluded</hi> from the Covenant now under the Gospel. And as Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> well noteth, <q>If it had been <hi>Christs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi> to exclude Infants,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Account of the Grounds of the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> p. 108.</note> there had been far greater reason for an express prohibition, than of an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press command,</hi> if his intention were to admit them; because this was suitable to the general Grounds of Gods dispensation among them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</q> And so Mr. <hi>Baxter:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In one of his Epistles to his Book for <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Baptism.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <q>If Christ had revoked Infants, Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membership, (and Interest in the Covenant together with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents) whether is it possible, that no word in Scripture should once mention it? nor one Apostle either question or discover it? or that the <hi>Jews,</hi> 1. Who were in present pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of it, 2. And were so hainously offended at the Non-circumcising of their Infants, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.21. would not once open their mouths to object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the total unchurching of them, which were an hundred times more? that neither the believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Jews</hi> should once scruple it, nor the unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing charge it on Christ, nor the Council, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. reveal it, even when those that taught Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, did take it for granted, that Infants were Church-members, or else they could not have said they must be circumcised. Is there a possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of all this, if the Scripture be perfect?</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="370" facs="tcp:34554:190"/>
               <p>The <hi>Anabaptists</hi> use to demand of us expresse Scripture for the Right of Infants; but we have <hi>more reason</hi> to demand of them plain Scripture, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding them from the Covenant, and denying their <hi>ancient priviledge</hi> of Church-membership. And had Children been cut off from that their ancient privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, it must needs have been one of the <hi>grand Questions</hi> in the Apostles dayes, and so would have been as cleerly decided, as that Question about Circumcision, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. But observe this, when it is plain and <hi>undenyable,</hi> that Infants were taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Covenant, and Church-members, if their Parents were in Covenant; they that would deny Infants this <hi>priviledge</hi> now, ought to bring as plain proof of Gods <hi>rescinding</hi> and revoking this priviledge of theirs, as we can bring of his granting it: which they have never yet done. Before any dare to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, God hath rescinded this ancient priviledge, they ought seriously to consider, how they can prove it, that they be not found <hi>false witnesses</hi> of God, as the Apostle speaks in another case.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We are able sufficiently to prove that the Gospel still supposeth Children to be <hi>in Covenant</hi> together with their Parents. What say you? will you be satisfied, if we can produce as clear <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-proof</hi> for Infants being still in Covenant, as Christ himself produced for the Resurrection? <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.32. Then I doubt not but you shall be satisfied.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That Text, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39. if there were no more, should satisfie you, <hi>[For the Promise is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you and to your Children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.]</hi> These words are brought in by the Apostle, as <hi>a
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:34554:190"/>motive</hi> to perswade his hearers to repent of their great sin in crucifying Christ, to own him as the promised <hi>Messiah,</hi> and to submit to the Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, shewing that neither <hi>they</hi> nor <hi>theirs</hi> should <hi>be loosers</hi> by it. That whereas they had impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Gods Curse on themselves and their children, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.25. and were now in danger to <hi>be cast off,</hi> yet coming in upon the Gospel-call, they should have the Promise still continued to them and theirs. That is, <hi>as with respect to Christ,</hi> God had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of his seed, and that in Christ, who was to come of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s seed, all the Families of the Earth should be blessed, (<hi>Acts</hi> 3.25.) this <hi>ancient</hi> and <hi>famous promise</hi> should yet hold good to them, as it was now also to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the Gentile Nations with them.</p>
               <p>Some would have <hi>[The Promise to you and to your Children]</hi> to referre unto that, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. where God promised to be a <hi>God unto Abraham,</hi> and <hi>to his seed.</hi> Others understand that Promise, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3. &amp; 22. <hi>v.</hi> 18. mentioned <hi>Act.</hi> 3.25. <hi>In thy seed shall all the Kindreds, or Families of the Earth be blessed.</hi> But indeed both these come to one. It was <hi>in that seed</hi> (in whom the Nations, Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds and Families of the Earth were to be blessed) that is, in Christ, and with respect unto Christ, that God promised to be <hi>a God unto Abraham,</hi> and to <hi>his seed.</hi> So the Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> 9as the Apostle saith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17.) was confirmed of God in Christ.</p>
               <p>Again, the blessing of the Nations, Kindreds, and Families of the Earth in <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, that is, in Christ, was taking them into Covenant, (that God was their God, and the God of their seed) the
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:34554:191"/>same Covenant for substance with that made with <hi>Abraham.</hi> As the blessing of <hi>Abraham</hi> came upon the <hi>Gentiles through Jesus Christ, Gal.</hi> 3.14. That God is our God, and the God of our seed, as he before promised unto <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that this is the plain meaning of the Apostle, <hi>The Promise is to you and your Children,</hi> if you do not cut off your selves by standing out against Christ, and not to you <hi>Jews</hi> only, but to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to all that are afar off, as many of them as the Lord shall call, <hi>to them,</hi> and <hi>their Children.</hi> And taking the words thus, you may see the harmony of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and how the Families of the Earth are <hi>blessed in Christ;</hi> how Believers under the Gospel are blessed with Faithfull <hi>Abraham;</hi> how the blessing promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to <hi>Abraham, [I will be a God to thee and to thy seed,]</hi> is come upon the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and how <hi>Abraham</hi> was made the Father of many Nations. He was the Father of <hi>many Nations,</hi> in that sence relating to the Covenant, wherein he was the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation: That as all the Natural seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> his seed <hi>by propagation,</hi> till they wilfully forsook and rejected the Covenant, were included in it, they and their Children; so the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> his seed <hi>by proportion,</hi> the called Gentiles, were priviledged, as his natural seed, being taken into the Covenant, <hi>they and their Children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Exception</hi> 1. It is not said, <hi>The Promise is to you,</hi> and <hi>to your Infants,</hi> but <hi>to you,</hi> and to <hi>your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> which might be of grown years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> When God promised to <hi>Abraham, I will be a God to thee and to thy seed,</hi> this took in Infants, though they were not named: So, <hi>The Promise is
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:34554:191"/>to you, and to your Children,</hi> must comprise Infants. None will deny, but <hi>Infants</hi> are <hi>Children;</hi> though all Children be not Infants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Exception</hi> 2. Some by <hi>the Promise</hi> here, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.28. recited in this Chapter, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.17. And to strengthen this Interpretation, they urge the foregoing words, <hi>v.</hi> 38. <hi>Repent and be baptized— and ye shall receive the Holy Ghost.</hi> For <hi>the promise is to you, and to your children—</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. This Interpretation is quite overthrown by the following words, [For the Promise is to you, and to your Children, and to <hi>all that are afar off,</hi> even to as many as the Lord our God shall call.] Now that Promise in <hi>Joel</hi> 2. is not made to <hi>all that are called.</hi> Have all the Spirit of Prophecy? Have all the gift of Tongues?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither hath Baptism reference to the confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of <hi>extraordinary Gifts</hi> of the Holy Ghost, though these followed the Baptism of some in the Primitive times, for a special reason: but it hath <hi>relation to the Covenant</hi> made with all that are called, as the Seal of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Except.</hi> 3. Some turn the words thus, <hi>The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is to you, and to your Children,</hi> that is, such of them <hi>as the Lord shall call.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Then these words <hi>[and to your children]</hi> are plainly superfluous. Unless they grant Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be called in their Parents call, there should be no more promised to their children here, than to all the men that were, or should be in the world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We cannot think, the Apostle would <hi>speak, fallaciously,</hi> with a mind to delude his Hearers. Now these his Hearers knew, that their Children ever till now, at least, were accounted <hi>Children of the
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:34554:192"/>Promises,</hi> and within the Covenant. And when the Apostle affirmeth the Promise to be made to them, and to <hi>their children,</hi> how should they understand him otherwise, than as asserting their <hi>ancient privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> in reference to their seed?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Taking the words otherwise, instead of being <hi>a motive,</hi> they would rather have been a disswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive; a Discouragement, instead of being an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to their submitting to the Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensation. <q>It had been a better Argument to have kept them in the Synagogue, than to have called them to the Christian Church,

               <p>Methinks these things are very plain,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Apostle speaks there of a breaking off from, and of being graffed into the <hi>visible Church.</hi> For, 1. There is no breaking from the <hi>invisible</hi> Church. If a member of the invisible Church may
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:34554:192"/>be <hi>broken off,</hi> then a true Believer may fall away from Grace. 2. The breaking off here mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was from that Church, of which the unbelieving Jews were <hi>natural branches, v.</hi> 24. Now they were natural branches of the Visible, not of the Invisible Church. 3. That Church into which the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Gentile-professors were <hi>graffed</hi> (in the the room of the Jews that were broken off,) was the Visible Church; for many of them were not members of the Invisible Church. They that were most apt to boast against the <hi>natural branches,</hi> and were in danger of being cut off, as well as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural branches, <hi>v.</hi> 18, 21. were no better than <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malists,</hi> and out-side Christians, who had onely a standing in the Visible Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Not <hi>all,</hi> but <hi>some</hi> of the Jews onely were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, <hi>v.</hi> 17. And if <hi>but some</hi> of the Jews were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, then some of them remained branches of the Olive still.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They that were broken off, were broken off, <hi>they and their seed,</hi> from the Church, and from the Covenant: They that were not broken off, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, <hi>they and their seed,</hi> within the Church, within the Covenant. For,</p>
               <p n="4">4. None were broken off, but <hi>because</hi> of Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>scil.</hi> their own, or their Parents. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Infants of the believing Jews were not <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off.</hi> They could not be broken off because of their Parents unbelief, when their Parents were Believers; nor for their <hi>own unbelief,</hi> when they were not capable of rejecting Christ and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, in their own persons. How could those Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren which were <hi>within the Church,</hi> and Covenant, before their Parents embraced the Gospel, be cast
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:34554:193"/>out, and cut off before they came actually to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Christ and the Gospel. If the Children of the believing Jews were not continued in the <hi>Olive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree</hi> with their Parents, to partake of the root and fatness thereof, then it will follow, that they were in the same state with <hi>those broken off.</hi> Now how strange is it, that they who were once in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and within the Church, received for their Fathers sakes, should be cast out again, without any fault of their own, or their Parents? would God revoke such a priviledge granted his people for their seed, unprovoked?</p>
               <p n="5">5. That Unbelief which <hi>brake off</hi> many of the Jews, was not barely the privation of true, saving, justifying Faith; but a positive, open, <hi>wilfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> of Christ and the Gospel. Which is plain thus, <hi>viz.</hi> Because divers who were not broken off were unbelievers in that first sence.</p>
               <p n="6">6. VVhat State and <hi>Priviledges</hi> the unbelieving Jews were broken off from, unto that state, and to those Priviledges, the main body of that People were again to be restored, <hi>v.</hi> 23, 24, 25, 26. The Apostle teacheth, they were to be graffed again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>their own Olive-tree.</hi> Now if their Children were not to be taken in with them, it would not be their <hi>own Olive,</hi> they were graffed in; but a Church of a quite different constitution, from what it was before the breaking off.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If the Children of the Jews that kept their place in the Church, and of them that were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to be taken in, must be looked on, as in an <hi>opposite state</hi> to that of the off-broken branches; we must say the same of the children of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile-professors. The <hi>believing Gentiles</hi> are graffed
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:34554:193"/>into that state from whence the unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> were broken, <hi>ver.</hi> 17.24. And there is now no <hi>Partition-wall;</hi> but <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> are all one in Christ Jesus, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.28. The <hi>Jews</hi> have no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge now above the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And besides, this was not the <hi>sole priviledge</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> before, but of any of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> as well, that became Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes, if they were <hi>Proselytes of the Covenant;</hi> their Children were taken into the Church, and into the Covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. If the believing <hi>Gentiles</hi> were graffed into the same Visible Church with the <hi>Jews,</hi> then they were to be Circumcised, as the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It follows not. 1. As one sayes, <q>
                     <hi>The House</hi> may be the same it was, though there be a <hi>new Door,</hi> or Porch to it.</q> We must distinguish betwixt the <hi>Essentials,</hi> and the <hi>Accidentals</hi> of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family was a Church before Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, and Circumcision did not <hi>change the Species</hi> of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If there was any strength in this Objection, it would follow, that the <hi>Jews</hi> could not be graffed into their <hi>own Olive-tree</hi> again, but they must be Circumcised. See here, who they are, that would bring in Judaism.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> are said to be graffed in a way <hi>contrary to Nature,</hi> into the Olive-tree, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. But your way would make them <hi>as the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural branches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> They were wild before their Ingraffing, not after; but being Engraffed, then they come to have the priviledge of the <hi>Natural branches.</hi> What the Apostle saith, [If thou wert cut out of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live-tree,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:34554:194"/>which is wilde by Nature; and wert graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed <hi>contrary to Nature,</hi> into a good Olive-tree.] Is to be understood of those <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were called out of Paganism, Heathenism, whose imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Parents were without the Church, strangers to the Covenant. But these being graffed into the good Olive-tree, their Children are buds, or Sprouts of the same Olive; as well as the Children of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Natural branches,</hi> were. And yet we acknowledge it a great Favour of God towards such Children, that they are descended of Parents, that are within Gods Covenant, and so compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the Covenant with their Parents.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another Text plain, and full for my present purpose, is that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Else were your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren unclean; but now they are holy.</hi> This is a third Scripture I produce for Childrens Interest in the Covenant with the Parents: In the mouth of two or three witnesses, the truth of what I last laid down, shall be established. These words are brought to remove a Scruple, which it seems trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the minds of some of the believing <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, scil.</hi> whereas some of them had unbelieving Yoke-follows, the doubt was, whether living with such were not a <hi>defiling of Conscience,</hi> a thing unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; whether the Infidel Husband should not be <hi>deserted;</hi> and the wife remaining a Pagan, or Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, should not be put away? Which the Apostle resolveth in the Negative, that they should not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse Cohabitation, and Society with their unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Yoke-fellows, <hi>ver.</hi> 12, 13. <hi>For the unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Husband is sanctified by, in, or to the believing Wife: Else were your children unclean, but now they are holy,</hi> ver. 14. Here note, 1. That by the
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:34554:194"/>
                  <hi>Wife,</hi> by, in, or to whom the <hi>unbelieving Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi> is sanctified, we are to understand the <hi>believing Wife;</hi> and by the <hi>Husband,</hi> by whom, or in, or to whom, the unbelieving wise is sanctified; we are to understand the <hi>believing Husband.</hi> For, 1. It is such a Wife as is opposed to an <hi>unbelieving Husband.</hi> And otherwise it had been enough to say, Only the Husband is sanctified by, or in the wife, and the wife is sanctified by, or in the Husband. And the Term, or Epithite <hi>[Ʋnbelieving]</hi> would be superfluous in both places. But it is too great boldness for any to say, the Apostle adds this word Superfluously. 2. The same parties are called, <hi>a Brother, a Sister,</hi> ver. 15. Again, 3. When the Apostle sayes, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>What knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy Husband? Or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?</hi> It is only the <hi>believing wife,</hi> or Husband, that he would put in some hopes of gaining their unbelieving Yoke-fellows. 4. The Apostle would not say, that the unbelieving Husband is sanctified by, or to the <hi>believing</hi> wife, or by, or to the wife, though an unbeliever. He affirmeth the contrary, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. To the unbelieving <hi>nothing is pure,</hi> or sanctified. If nothing be sanctified to them, then no Relation is sanctified.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That when he speaks of their Children being <hi>holy,</hi> he speaks of Believers Children, as such. To call the Children of Pagans, and Infidels, <hi>holy,</hi> is a strange, uncouth speech; and such as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not acquainted with. But that the Children of Gods People are an <hi>holy Seed,</hi> this the Scripture owneth, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 9.2.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Therefore when he calleth their Children <hi>holy,</hi>
                  <pb n="380" facs="tcp:34554:195"/>he must necessarily mean more than <hi>Legitimate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, 1. The Children of Infidels, if begotten in lawful wedlock were <hi>Legitimate,</hi> as well as theirs. But what the Apostle sayes here, he saith only of a believers Children, not of the Children of Pagans, and Infidels. Here the Apostle supposeth, or granteth, that if one of the Parents had not been a believer, and so the other Parent sanctified (by virtue of the Covenant) in, or to him, then the Children indeed had been <hi>unclean,</hi> not <hi>holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They that take <hi>[holy]</hi> for Legitimate, must take the word <hi>[sanctified]</hi> for made lawful; in the foregoing clauses. But they will never find the word <hi>[sanctified]</hi> used only for that which is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Besides, so the Apostle should argue weakly, that it is lawful for the believer to live with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing Yoke-fellow, because it is lawful. Again, this of the unbelieving Husband <hi>being sanctified</hi> by, or to the believing VVife; they that are not minded to wrangle, may see plainly is made an <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> or consequent of her being a believer; but that which was not lawful before, cannot be made <hi>lawful</hi> by ones believing: Or if it was lawful before, then it is not ones believing that made it so.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Taking [holy] for <hi>Legitimate,</hi> the Apostle should go about to prove <hi>Ignotum per ignotius:</hi> To clear one thing doubted of, he should bring in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which might possbly be more <hi>doubted of:</hi> Which is going about indeed. Might not one of these believers have less doubt, whether such an Infidel was his wife, than whether the Children were indeed his children? The Apostle argues here as from an <hi>acknowledged Principle,</hi> that they were well
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:34554:195"/>satisfied of; that their Children were not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>unclean,</hi> but <hi>holy.</hi> Now would any man think the Apostle so weak, to go about to prove, that such a Couple were <hi>lawful man and wife,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their Children were Legitimate. Or that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were so senseless, as to doubt whether they lived not in <hi>Fornication,</hi> while they lived with their unbelieving Yoke-fellows; and yet to have no doubt, but that the Issue they had by them was <hi>Legitimate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. We shall never find the word <hi>[holy]</hi> used for <hi>Legitimate.</hi> Then is not that likely to be a <hi>private Interpretation,</hi> that takes it so here? And is it to be imagined, that when the Apostle is writing to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie <hi>scrupulous Consciences,</hi> he would use a word in that sence, they were none of them likely to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand; as being never used, and taken in such a sence before, and that without any thing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain it?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Taking the word <hi>[Holy]</hi> for <hi>Legitimate,</hi> it would follow, that the Apostle is besides the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, and does not speak to the <hi>Corinthians scruple.</hi> Have not they a strong fancy, who can conceit such a thing, that diverse of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> because their Yoke-fellows remained <hi>Infidels,</hi> were afraid, if they Lived with them still, they should be guilty of the sin of <hi>Fornication,</hi> and defile their bodies? But we have no ground to think this troubled them, as if they feared, this were to be dishonest: No, <hi>Marriage is honourable among all,</hi> Heb. 13.4. And yet though Marrirge be <hi>lawful in it self,</hi> they might scruple notwithstanding, whether to live in society with such as were Idolaters, and open Enemies to God, and Jesus Christ; might not be <hi>Irreligious,</hi> and
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:34554:196"/>a defiling of their Consciences. Now this being their scruple, not the other, What <hi>satisfaction</hi> could it be, to tell them, that their Marriage was lawful <hi>on a civil account,</hi> so that their Children were Legitimate, not Bastards? Notwithstanding that, they might fear Spiritual defilement in it.</p>
               <p>Lay all these particulars together, and I hope, when the Apostle says of these believers Children, that they were <hi>holy,</hi> you will be satisfied; he must mean something more, than that they were not <hi>Bastards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. And therefore how can we understand it, but that they are <hi>holy in relation</hi> to God, holy as sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated to God. Holy, by virtue of his Covenant with the believer, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy Seed.</hi> So if but one of the Parents be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Covenant, it takes in the Seed with him: Till the opposite party can find out some other sence, and make it out to be the sence, this must stand.</p>
               <p>All must grant, that the general use of the word <hi>[holy]</hi> is for a thing or person separated to God. Which Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Of Infant Bapt.</hi> p. 81.</note> clearly and fully distinguisheth thus: <q>1. A Thing or Person may be Holy, or seperated to God, either <hi>in state</hi> and standing Relation, or only for some <hi>particular Act,</hi> or Use. Infants, while Infants, are not capable of any such work for God: Therefore it is an <hi>Holiness of state,</hi> which is ascribed to them.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <q>Those that are holy thus in state, are either Holy by <hi>meer Separation</hi> and Relation; or else they are also qualified with Endowments sutable to the state.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="383" facs="tcp:34554:196"/>
               <p n="3">3. <q>There is a Sanctifying, or Separating to God, either <hi>Directly</hi> and <hi>Immediately:</hi> So every believer, and so their Children are sanctified. and there is a Separating, or Sanctifying to God <hi>remotely</hi> and <hi>secondarily.</hi> Thus the unbelieving Husband, or Wife, is sanctified to the Believer; both as being separated to one who is <hi>separated to God,</hi> and as an Husband, or VVife, they make up that Conjugal state which is more directly for God: And if they beget an <hi>holy seed,</hi> it is one of the Uses, that they were sanctified to.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <q>Sometimes Persons, or Things, are sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Actively,— and sometimes Passively.—</q>
               </p>
               <p>And as he notes, <q>All these Distinctions are but from several ends and <hi>degrees of separation.</hi> The common Nature of Holiness, is one and the same in all; that is, a <hi>separation to God.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Now the word <hi>[Holy}</hi> constantly denoting a Thing, or Person <hi>separated to God,</hi> either in State, or to some particular Act, or Use; and Children being called <hi>holy,</hi> who are not capable, while In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, of the latter way of separation to God, but were known to have been <hi>separated to God</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer way, to stand in the same Covenant-relation with their Parents, and called an <hi>holy Seed;</hi> as when the People of the <hi>Jews</hi> are oft called an <hi>holy People,</hi> (<hi>Deut.</hi> 14.2. and 26.19. <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.24.) We are to understand not only the <hi>Adult,</hi> but the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; the Infants among them, were a part of that <hi>holy People:</hi> These things considered, we have no ground to understand what the Apostle says here of a believers Children being <hi>holy,</hi> otherwise, than that they are in Covenant-relation to God, as the Seed of his People formerly were; <hi>holy in state,</hi>
                  <pb n="384" facs="tcp:34554:197"/>separated to God. I say, we have no ground to understand the Apostle here otherwise, nor were the <hi>Corinthians likely to understand</hi> him otherwise, unless he had otherwise explained himself; or some evident Reason could be brought, that the word <hi>[holy}</hi> cannot be so taken here.</p>
               <p>Surely that sence of the word which fully agrees with the <hi>Ʋse</hi> of the word in other Scriptures, and best suites with the <hi>Scope</hi> of this place; that ought to be acknowledged the sence here. But to take the word <hi>holy,</hi> as we do, fully agreeth with the use of the word in other Scriptures (as they, the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site party cannot but acknowledge) and best suites with the Scope of this place.</p>
               <p>Now that it best suits with the scope of this place, appears thus; that here the Apostle would satisfie, and <hi>remove a scruple</hi> of some of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> whether to live with their Yoke-fellows, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained Infidels, were not <hi>Irreligious;</hi> and that that would defile their Consciences? Now for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to tell them, that their Children were <hi>Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi> (which is the sence the Opposite party must stick to, and the best sence they have, to bring in opposition to that we lay down) this would not come up to the <hi>Corinthians scruple,</hi> as I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but ours does, proving that it was not Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious for believers to continue with their Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Yoke-fellows, since they were sanctified to, or by them, and their Children <hi>holy,</hi> or separated to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. VVould not this prove it lawful for a believer, supposing him guilty of Fornication, to Live with the Fornicatrix, if the Child so begotten be holy, and within the Covenant?</p>
               <pb n="385" facs="tcp:34554:197"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This Objection is so commonly taken off by almost every one of ours that urge this Text, that I might pass it by, without mentioning. Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> hath spoken to it fully,
<note place="margin">Of Infant Bapt.</note> and cleared this Text so, that (as Learned <hi>Rutherford,</hi> says,) <q>
                     <hi>The Dispute now is at an end.</hi>
                  </q> Indeed, I should be of his mind, if men were not Prejudiced, Conceited, or <hi>minded to Cavil.</hi> Though the Child of a Believer, as it is his Child, may be taken into Covenant (though it was <hi>gotten in Fornication;</hi>) Yet is not that a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Measure of Charity, than the Word allows of, to suppose that one may <hi>live in Fornication,</hi> and be a Believer, or be so Reputed? We think such an one ought to be cast out of the Church; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, <hi>his Children,</hi> as such, should have no right to any Church-priviledges, nor be reputed <hi>holy.</hi> That if such Children be admitted, it should be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>the account</hi> of some <hi>other,</hi> who hath not For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited his Covenant-right, and hath the Child at his dispose.</p>
               <p>But more directly, to the Objection: It is <hi>no better Reasoning,</hi> than the Devil used, to perswade our Saviour to cast himself down from the Pinacle of the Temple; saying, <hi>[It is written, He shall give his Angels charge concerning thee.]</hi> Leaving out the condition, <hi>[To keep thee in all thy ways,]</hi> see <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.6. with <hi>Psal.</hi> 91.11. The Apostle teacheth this indeed, that they that were <hi>lawful Man and Wife,</hi> might Live together as Man and VVife, though the one was a Believer, and the other an Infidel, without crossing the Rules of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; which he cleareth thus, Gods <hi>Law or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> which availed to the putting of the Issue of
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:34554:198"/>such Parents into an Holy, or Church-state, as Children <hi>separated to God;</hi> would as well avail to the sanctifying of the unbelieving Yoke-fellow, to the believers use in a <hi>Conjugal-state.</hi> And that if they held it a <hi>prophane thing,</hi> to Live still with such as were Infidels, they had as much reason to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the Children they had by such, <hi>unclean;</hi> and in <hi>no better state,</hi> than other Children; where both the Parents were Pagans and Idolaters. Now what the Apostle says here, to prove that a believer may <hi>without Impiety,</hi> Live still with his Yoke-fellow, upon this account; that such a Yoke-fellow is <hi>san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified</hi> to his lawful use in Marriage, cannot be stretched to the case of <hi>Fornicators,</hi> who are not sanctified one to the others use; nor lawful Man and VVife, as the other are presupposed to be. VVhat is not <hi>lawful,</hi> cannot be <hi>sanctified.</hi> A state of Incest, or Fornication, cannot be <hi>sanctified,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>sinful.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Of Infant Bapt.</hi> p. 98.</note> And as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> says, "God sanctifieth not sin in, or to any (though he may bring good out of it.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. VVhat is said of the Children here, the like is said of the unbelieving Parent. As the Children are said to be <hi>holy,</hi> so the unbelieving Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are said to be <hi>sanctified?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> are not alike. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things are <hi>sanctified</hi> in, or to a believer, that are not therefore <hi>holy.</hi> Afflictions are sanctified, Food is sanctified, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.4, 5. yet not <hi>holy.</hi> VVhen the Apostle speaks of the unbelieving Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band being <hi>sanctified,</hi> he is careful to limit it, and shews in what respect, <hi>to whose use</hi> he is sanctified; that is, <hi>to the believer:</hi> But there is no such Restri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or Limitation, when he speaks of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:34554:198"/>being <hi>holy;</hi> If they are holy, they are <hi>holy to God:</hi> If not <hi>Inherently,</hi> yet at least Foederally, and <hi>Relatively.</hi> So the Children of a Proselyte before, stood in Covenant-relation to God, as an <hi>holy seed,</hi> though it might so happen, that the other Parent would not come in, as a Proselyte.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If <hi>sanctified,</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> here are all one, and mean only a <hi>civil Holiness,</hi> (as some would have it) or <hi>lawful to use,</hi> it was <hi>lawful</hi> to the unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to use his Child, as his Child, as well as to the believer; and yet to the unbelieving nothing is <hi>sanctified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Or if Children are called <hi>holy;</hi> In respect of an holy, sanctified use to be made of them, it would follow, that the Apostle had no <hi>Special reason</hi> to bring in their Children here, but that they come in somewhat oddly; when it had been as much to his purpose to have <hi>named any thing else.</hi> And so he might as well have said, your Acquaintance, Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, Neighbours, are <hi>holy;</hi> that is, you may make an holy use of them, your Callings are holy, And what not?</p>
               <p n="4">4. If by <hi>sanctified,</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> in this place the Apostle only intends a <hi>Matrimonial,</hi> and <hi>civil Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness;</hi> opposed to Fornication, Uncleanness, and Bastardy (as some tell us;) then they must <hi>hold,</hi> that the Apostle alloweth us to say, That all lawfully Married persons, keeping to their own Husbands, or VVives, are <hi>sanctified;</hi> and that he allows us to call all that are not Bastards, or Illegitimate, <hi>Holy,</hi> or Saints.</p>
               <p>Here now I cast mine eye upon what one of note, and much cried up among the opposite party, hath lately written.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>H. D.</hi> p. 191.</note>
                  <q>There
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:34554:199"/>is no such holiness in the New Testament, as a <hi>Foederal holiness</hi> belonging to children.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>(1) Because it contradicts the Gospel-dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as before.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> By <hi>foederal holiness</hi> of Children, we mean their standing together with Parents in Covenant-relation to God. That this is agreeable to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-dispensation, I have proved before. It is <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams Covenant,</hi> that the believing Gentiles are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into. In which Covenant God promiseth to be a God to his people, and to their seed, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39. And <hi>if the Root be holy, so are the Branches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>(2) Because such Apprehensions intail Grace to Nature, Regeneration to Generation, <hi>in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction</hi> to that of our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. <hi>That which is born of the flesh is flesh.</hi> And that we are all <hi>children of wrath by nature,</hi> Eph. 2.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. How many Anabaptists, that plainly contradict these Scriptures, denying that Infants have any sin, who thence conclude, that they have no need of Baptisme?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Children of Believers under the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament were <hi>flesh, conceived in sin,</hi> and brought forth in <hi>iniquity,</hi> children of <hi>wrath</hi> by Nature, yet were they in the Covenant.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Therefore, to be Children of wrath by Nature, considered <hi>as the corrupt Off-spring</hi> of fallen <hi>Adam,</hi> and to be children of the Covenant <hi>by priviledge,</hi> and Grace, as they descend from believing Parents, to whom God hath promised, <hi>I will be your God, and the God of your seed;</hi> these two are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to one another.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>(3) Because it contradicts all the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, both of former and later times, wherein
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:34554:199"/>godly men have had wicked children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Observe again, this Reason would overthrow the <hi>Covenant-holiness</hi> of the children of the Jews under the former dispensation; wherein he contradicts himself, and the whole current of the Old Testament.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Here he grossely mistakes, and confounds Foederal, <hi>relative holiness,</hi> with <hi>real,</hi> personal, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent holiness.</hi> Many of those who are called the <hi>holy seed, Ezr.</hi> 9.2. in regard of Gods Covenant made with them, and their relations to God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that account, were yet in another respect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>(4) Because it necessitates an owning the Doctrine of Falling from Grace.</q>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ib. p</hi> 192.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. How many Anabaptists that are not afraid to own that Doctrine? I have sometimes lived amongst many of that way, where were more <hi>Arminian-Anabaptists,</hi> than Antinomian-Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists; and scarce one that I could hear of among them, a meer Anabaptist, that held that Errour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for the Children of Believers that growing up, do not stand to the Covenant, we cannot say they <hi>fell from Grace,</hi> which they never had. Though many do suppose the Infants of Believers that die in Infancy, renewed, and <hi>sanctified,</hi> to fit them for glory; yet as for those that live till they come to be of capacity, there is <hi>more required</hi> of them in the Covenant, as the Parents are bound by their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to train them up for God, so the <hi>Children are bound</hi> to receive Instruction, and to comply with other Gods Means, in order to a sanctifying, saving work. As a learned Writer noteth, <q>Infants are
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:34554:200"/>in Covenant with the holy Ghost <hi>conditionally</hi> as their Parents are,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Christ. Directory.</hi> p. 821. sect. 9.</note>— The holy Ghost is promised in Baptism to give the Child Grace in his Parents and his own faithfull use of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed means.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The unbelieving Jews before their breaking off, were <hi>foederally holy.</hi> And if their breaking off will not necessitate an owning the Doctrine of Fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away from Grace, neither doth what we hold inferre it.</p>
               <p>The same Author goes on to prove that <q>The Text intends a <hi>Civil or Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Holiness</hi> (as he calls it) in opposition to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 192.</note> Uncleanness, Bastardy.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This he saith, is proved, 1. <q>From the scope of the place.</q> Implying, that the Question propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the believing <hi>Corinthians,</hi> which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle here resolves, was, Whether they could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue Marriage-society with their unbelieving Yoke-fellows, without being <hi>guilty of Fornication?</hi> Yet as he layes it down, no such thing appears, but it is well, he had told us his meaning before. Now he would have the Apostle here to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue <hi>ab Absurdo.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 193.</note>
                  <q>Inasmuch as they had no question of their childrens Legitimacy, neither had they any cause to scruple the other, that is, that they were lawfully married.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This would make these <hi>Corinthians</hi> as <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd men</hi> as were ever heard of, to doubt whether their Marriage was lawfull, in opposition to Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and yet to have <hi>no doubt,</hi> but their Children were legitimate. For it is impossible to know the children are legitimate, without knowing first, that
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:34554:200"/>the Parents were lawfull Man and Wife. And they that doubt whether they are lawfull Man and Wife, cannot <hi>but doubt,</hi> whether their children are legitimate. And they that have no doubt of the <hi>Legitimacy</hi> of their Children, take it for granted, or necessarily suppose, they are lawfull Man and Wife.</p>
               <p>He goes on, <q>The Believer had least ground to doubt hereof, because to him all <hi>lawfull</hi> things are <hi>clean</hi>— which is all the Holiness I conceive can be meant in the Text, agreeable to the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4.3, 4. &amp; <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.15. The Bastard being among the unclean, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.2.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Then in his Opinion, to the Believer all <hi>lawfull</hi> things are <hi>only lawfull.</hi> When we read they are pure, and sanctified to the Believer, is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only this, they are <hi>lawfull?</hi> Are they not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to others too? When the Apostle sayes, To the unbelieving nothing is <hi>pure,</hi> can his meaning be, that nothing is <hi>lawfull?</hi> Then we must per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them never to marry, nor eat, nor drink, nor work, nor sleep. For it is not lawfull for them to do any of these.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Text, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4.3, 4. <hi>This is the will of God, even your sanctification,</hi>] is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to a Civil, or <hi>Matrimonial Holiness,</hi> in that Authors sence, but intends all holy Conversation, And Purity of Life, to which Fornication, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness is greatly opposite. But no sound Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitor will say, that the Heathen, who lived chastly, <hi>came up to that,</hi> which the Apostle here exhorteth unto. Certainly, there is a great difference betwixt the Chastity of a moralized Heathen, and <hi>Christian purity,</hi> which is required here.</p>
               <pb n="392" facs="tcp:34554:201"/>
               <p n="3">3. To that Text, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.15. <hi>A godly seed,</hi> or seed of God. It is not the same with <hi>holy seed.</hi> Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I see not, why it should mean no more than <hi>legitimate.</hi> Did he only seek a legitimate seed? Rather, (as <hi>Grotius) Hoc unicè agebat, ut liberos haberet qui Deum colerent: vos autem eas praefertis matres quae filios ad idola deducant;</hi> He sought to have Children, who might be true Worshippers of God; whereas the persons there reproved af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected strangers, and such women as drew their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to Idolatry.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.2. If Bastards were held un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, as being so <hi>legally,</hi> and <hi>typically,</hi> yet there is no reason to think, that the Apostle would call them <hi>unclean,</hi> when that Law was abrogated, which made them so.</p>
               <p>His second Argument is just the same with the second Objection answered a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 194.</note>
               </p>
               <p>His third Argument that Children are not to be taken for Infants only,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 195.</note> is of as little force. As Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> notes, when the Apostle saith thus of the Children of a believer, <hi>But now they are holy,</hi> he speaketh in the common phrase of his own Nation. As the seed of Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes were said to be <hi>born in Holiness,</hi> that is, within the Religion, not in Heathenism. Yet it was possible that some of their Children, who were grown up, might not accept of Gods Covenant, and so not be proselyted with their Parents: Now he may as well say, that <hi>I will be a God to thee and to thy seed,</hi> did not hold good to Proselytes, because some of their seed might still remain Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</p>

Though some of Gods Elect may be among the Heathen, and Idolaters, yet they are not within the Covenant, meerly because they are within the decree of Election. They are not in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, till renouncing their Paganism, they come to know, and worship the true God.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) <q>From the concurrent Testimony, and Confession of many Learned Commentators, and Parties themselves.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> We must grant a concurrence here among Popish Expositors, taking <hi>holy</hi> for <hi>legitimate,</hi> and we know it is to serve a turn.

               <p>Further I desire you to weigh this Argument, to prove Children in Covenant together with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: Either the children of Believers are taken into Covenant together with their Parents still, or it is worse with the Faithfull, in respect of their seed, now since the coming of Christ, than it was
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:34554:202"/>before. But it is no worse now with the Faithfull in respect of their seed, than it was before. For that would make the Church a <hi>great loser</hi> by Christs coming, whereas she is a <hi>gainer.</hi> Then <hi>Christi ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventu factum fuerit ut obscurior &amp; minus testata sit nobis Dei gratia quàm antè Judaeis erat,</hi> (as <hi>Calv.) Num post Christum, factam esse deteriorem parvu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum sortem existimemus? Whitaker.</hi> It is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, that those Jews, who <hi>embraced the Faith</hi> of Christ, if they onely had the Promise, that God would be their God, so that their children were <hi>left out,</hi> that God promised no longer to be the God of their Seed, then they could not but see themselves in <hi>a worse Condition,</hi> in respect of their children, than they were before. And how unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable is it to think, that when the Scripture makes cutting off from the Covenant so sad a Judgement, and the fruit of Unbelief, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the believing Jews, which were in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant once, should be cut off upon their Parents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>(i. e.)</hi> cut off for no fault? And would not this be dishonourable unto Christ, whose coming certainly was not to lessen, but enlarge his peoples Priviledges? and according to this Doctrine, it should have been a greater priviledge to be born under the Law, than to be born under the Gospel. And how <hi>derogatory</hi> to the Grace of God, which he would have to shine forth more gloriously in the Gospel-dispensation?</p>
               <p>Whereas one sayes, <q>This is no more to be esteemed the loss of a priviledge, than our not enjoying literally a Holy Land, City, Temple, a succession of an High-priest, and a Priesthood by Generation, or Lineal descent.]</q> We can tell
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:34554:203"/>them, we have <hi>greater mercies</hi> and priviledges in the room of these. But it is a wonderfull strange thing, that any Christian Parent should account it <hi>no priviledge,</hi> for God to be the God of his seed. As heretofore he promised his people, to be the God of <hi>their seed.</hi> If the children of Gods people now are out of Covenant, I wonder what priviledge they can have, in lieu of that, which is denyed to them.</p>
               <p>And whereas some tell us, The state of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church is more <hi>spiritual,</hi> than to admit of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; they may as well exclude all Infants out of Heaven. Doubtless, the state of the <hi>Church Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant</hi> is as spiritual, as the state of the Church Militant on Earth. If Infants may be Members of the <hi>Church Triumphant,</hi> what reason can be given, but Infants may be also members of the Church Militant on Earth? Indeed, if they are not <hi>of the Church,</hi> if they be not in Covenant, then are they in the same Estate with the Heathen, and the Jews that are broken off; that for the present we should be without hope concerning them.</p>
               <p>Again, methinks, there is something of weight in this, to prove that our Children are in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, as well as the children of the Jews were heretofore; because it is as much our Duty to <hi>train them up for God,</hi> as ever it was the Duty of the Jews. What God required of the Jews, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.7. <hi>Thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children,</hi> &amp;c. The like is required of us Christians, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.4. we must bring up our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <hi>in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</hi> Now how strange were it, if God should require us to train up our children for him, and yet not own
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:34554:203"/>them for his? Then we should not have so much Encouragement to our Duty here, as the people of the Jews had before. Then the Jews had <hi>more help,</hi> more to hearten them to their Duty, than we. Can this be so, and yet we be under a <hi>better,</hi> a more gracious dispensation of the Covenant, than they? Surely, in this respect, we should <hi>come short</hi> of them. It will not enter into my thoughts, that where the Duty is the same to us, and to the Jews of old, we should not have <hi>equal Priviledge</hi> with them at least, and equal Encouragement to what they had.</p>
               <p>Lastly, I would ask those that would race our childrens Names out of the Covenant, What is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of all those <hi>gracious Promises</hi> of Old made to the seed of Gods people? That Promise, <hi>I will cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy seed.</hi> May not Believers plead this Promise still, as well as heretofore the People of God might have done? And yet how can they do it, if their <hi>seed</hi> now are <hi>left out of</hi> Covenant? Does God make that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to any out of Covenant? So the Lord promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, <hi>Isa.</hi> 44.3. <hi>I will pour out my Spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine off-spring.</hi> And <hi>Isa.</hi> 59.21. <hi>As for me, this is my Covenant with them, saith the Lord, My Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seeds seed, saith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever.</hi> So we read, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.26. <hi>The seed of the Righteous is blessed.</hi> And <hi>Isa.</hi> 61.9. <hi>They are the seed which the Lord hath blessed.</hi> And <hi>Isa.</hi> 65.23. <hi>They are the seed of the Blessed of the Lord, and
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:34554:204"/>their Off-spring with them.</hi> What shall we say? That the people of God might have pleaded these Promises heretofore; but they do not concern us under the Gospel? Then Believers now have no ground to plead them with God, or to <hi>hang their Off-spring and issue upon him,</hi> as his people had heretofore. And so there was more grace extended <hi>to the Jews</hi> under the former Dispensation of the Covenant. If such Promises do as well concern us Christians, as they did the Jews; if we may plead these Promises with God on the behalf of our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, certainly they are <hi>Covenant-Promises.</hi> And if these Promises belong to our seed, the Covenant must as well belong to them. Remember that, God <hi>promiseth such things</hi> to none that are out of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. If it be objected, These things are not made good to <hi>all the seed of the Jews:</hi> Yet I suppose it will not be denyed, but these were <hi>some of those</hi> Promises which the Apostle reckoneth among the great Priviledges of the <hi>Jews, Rom.</hi> 9.4. And the Question is, Whether ever God faileth of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these Promises, but where there was some <hi>gross failure</hi> on the Parents part, or on the Childes, or on both, their not doing their part towards the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of them.</p>
               <p>I hope enough hath been said to evince it, that where the Parents are in Covenant, their children are in Covenant too.</p>
               <p>Now by way of Corollary and Inference, Note the <hi>Warrantableness of Infant-baptisme.</hi> The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of Christians being in Covenant together with their Parents, and Baptism being the <hi>initiating Sign and Seal</hi> of the Covenant; they that are in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, must needs have right to the initiating Seal
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:34554:204"/>of the Covenant. They that are known to be in Covenant, may be <hi>declared to be so</hi> by Baptism, (the Sign of entrance into Covenant,) that being an end of Baptism, to distinguish those that are entred into Covenant with God, from those who are not in Covenant. Certainly, <hi>to be in Covenant</hi> with God, is a greater matter than to have the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sign:</hi> And there can be no reason to deny the outward sign of entrance into the Covenant, to those that we can prove entered into the Covenant, as children are together with their Parents.</p>
               <p>And there was no other ground imaginable (I think) upon which such strangers as dwelt not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Jews, as their <hi>Servants,</hi> nor among them, as <hi>Sojourners,</hi> but in another Countrey, such as the Eunuch, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.27. were circumcised, and so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and <hi>joyned to the Church</hi> of the Jews. There was no express command for the circumcising of such Proselytes as were neither Servants nor So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journers among them, yet were they circumcised upon that <hi>general ground</hi> of their entring into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> taking him for their God; as if they had not been <hi>circumcised,</hi> they had been debarred from joyning in Temple-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. (See <hi>Act.</hi> 21.28.) The Covenant, <hi>[I will be a God to thee, and to thy seed,]</hi> was the ground of the Command, <hi>Thou shalt keep my covenant, therefore thou and thy seed,</hi> particularly, <hi>every male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child among you shall be circumcised, in token of the Covenant.</hi> See <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7, 9, 10.</p>
               <p>But against what I have laid down, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of Christians being in Covenant, they must needs have right to the <hi>initiatory Seal</hi> of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, it is objected:</p>
               <pb n="400" facs="tcp:34554:205"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Objection</hi> 1. That all the faithfull, from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi> received no such Seal.

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Now what a <hi>pitifull Evasion</hi> is this? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause persons in Covenant did not receive any <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory Seal</hi> (that we know of) in that state of the Church, when there was <hi>no such seal</hi> (that we know of) appointed by God; therefore persons within the Covenant, have no right to the initiatory Seal of the Covenant, when such a Seal is instituted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Objection</hi> 2. Neither did any Believers out of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>H.D.</hi> p. 206.</note> as <hi>Lot, Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedek,</hi> receive any such Seal, that we read of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. A particular Exception or two will not overthrow a <hi>General Rule.</hi> If <hi>Lot,</hi> and <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedek</hi> were not circumcised, there might be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>extraordinary</hi> in their case: As Gods not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to settle and continue a Church in their Families, as he did in <hi>Abrahams Family,</hi> therefore he might give and appoint Circumcision to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and not to them. 2. It is false, that none out of <hi>Abrahams Family</hi> were to be circumcised. The Proselytes of the Covenant could not be so, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Circumcision.</hi> And such an one was the Eunuch, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. though not of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 3. Some to whom the Covenant did not belong, received that, called the <hi>initiating Seal</hi> of Circumcision. As <hi>Ishmael,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ. Ishmael</hi> was externally, visibly in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, at that time when he was <hi>circumcised,</hi> though he was afterwards by Gods Sentence cast out of the Church, and dis-covenanted. The strangers in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s house, or bought with Money in <hi>Israel,</hi> that
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:34554:205"/>were Circumcised, were no doubt, some of them Internally, and all of them Externally in Covenant, and of the Visible Church.</p>
               <p>As for that Circumcision which some <hi>Gentile</hi>-Nations took up from the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>De repub. Heb.</hi> l. 3. c. 5.</note> which <hi>Cunaeus,</hi> and others, take notice of; it was not the Ordinance, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Circumcision used among them, but an <hi>Apish Immitation.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 4. But some will go further and Object, That if all within the Covenant have thereupon <hi>a Right</hi> to <hi>the Seal</hi> of <hi>Admission,</hi> then it will follow, that the whole body of the <hi>Jews</hi> should have been Baptized, had a <hi>right to Babtism,</hi> being within the Covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I have told you before, that though the Covenant of Grace be one and the <hi>same for substance</hi> in all Ages; yet there have been <hi>various dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of it. And as the Dispensations have differed, God has appointed <hi>different seals of Admission.</hi> And as God hath revealed himself more plainly and fully in the Letter, than he had done in the former Dispensation; so <hi>proportionably</hi> more hath been required to mens being taken into Covenant in this Dispensation. From <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of Christ was more Dark and Indeterminate. To <hi>Abraham</hi> he was promised to come out of his Loins, and that <hi>in his Seed all Nations should be blessed.</hi> And under his Dispensation, God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not only the belief of that general promise gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Adam,</hi> that the <hi>Seed of the woman should break the Serpents head;</hi> but also that the promised Messiah was to be of <hi>Abraham Seed.</hi> After this gracious Revelation to <hi>Abraham,</hi> this <hi>new Article
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:34554:206"/>of Faith</hi> was to be received, owned, and professed in the Church, into which Circumcision was a sign and <hi>Seal of Entrance,</hi> and admission. And when afterwards God delivered his Law by <hi>Moses</hi> to the people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> then they that would <hi>joyn themselves to the Church,</hi> must not only profess to believe the promised Messiah, but that he was willing to be Governed by those Laws. And a <hi>Proselyte of the Gate,</hi> as he was called, that had liberty to Dwell, or Sojourn among the <hi>Jews,</hi> only observing the <hi>seven Precepts</hi> given to the Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> (as they were called) was not owned as a Member of the Jewish Church, but distinguished from the <hi>Proselyte of the Covenant,</hi> that was Circumcised, and received the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> Again, when Christ was come in the Flesh, then was the clearest Dispensation of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace. And then this became a new <hi>article of Faith</hi> to believe; that <hi>this was he.</hi> And when he appointed Baptism a Sign and <hi>Seal of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> into the Covenant, and Church under the Gospel, the Faith of a <hi>Jew,</hi> to believe <hi>a Messias to come;</hi> was not enough, where the Faith of a Christian was necessarily required, <hi>scil.</hi> To believe that <hi>this was he</hi> indeed, who was to come, and no other to be looked for. Now the <hi>Jews</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing they were <hi>in Covenant before,</hi> yet since this new Dispensation, if they will stick to the former Dispensation, and not admit of it in that <hi>further De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,</hi> God is pleased to make, they can have no right to the Initiating Seal: But plainly cast themselves out of Covenant. I hope this is plain, and satisfactory.</p>
               <p>But to strengthen what we laid down before, I
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:34554:206"/>shall prove by Scripture, that Children, Infants, <hi>being in Covenant</hi> together with their Parents, they have a right to Baptism, the Initiating Seal of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>And, 1. So much is implied in the Commission, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go ye therefore, and Teach</hi> (or, as the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Disciple) <hi>all Nations, Baptizing them.</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as the Learned Note, and both sides com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly agree. Now suppose the Commission had run thus [<hi>Go, Disciple the Nation of the</hi> Jews, <hi>Baptizing them.</hi>] How could the Apostles once have thought, but they must have Baptized their Children with their Parents; as Children were <hi>a part of the Nation,</hi> and were constantly taken into the Church, and Covenant with their Parents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? Unless Children had been <hi>plainly Excepted</hi> in the Commission here, as they are not, the Apostles must needs take their Commission to <hi>reach unto Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> with their Parents still, that all the Children of Parents Discipled, were to be baptized, as well as their Parents. Or suppose <hi>Circumcision</hi> had been continued, as the <hi>Initiating Seal,</hi> or Sacrament of Admission under the Gospel, that the Commission had run thus: <hi>Go, Proselyte, or Disciple all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Circumcising them:</hi> Or suppose the like Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission had been granted to the Prophets of old. Go, <hi>Proselyte all Nations, Circumcising them;</hi> and Teaching them to observe the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and all the Statutes, and Ordinances, which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you: Must not <hi>Children</hi> have been taken in here together with the Parents, except the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry had been declared by the same Authority?</p>
               <p>And this is undeniable, that Children are a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:34554:207"/>part</hi> of any Nation: and if Children are not capable of being Difcipled, and Baptized, then a <hi>Nation properly</hi> is not capable of being Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled, and Baptized? And so Christ set his Apostles here upon a Task impossible to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
               <p>And methinks, it is very considerable, that <hi>[all Nations]</hi> here:

               <p>And as yet, I see not any reason to be of Mr. <hi>George Galaspy</hi>'s mind, who would have this of <hi>Baptizing Proselytes,</hi> a corrupt Invention, or Tradition of the later <hi>Jews.</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, it might very well be supposed, that the Heathen, who wanted the <hi>Rule to</hi> teach them to put a difference betwixt the Clean, and Unclean, (as <hi>Lev.</hi> 11.) were <hi>Legally unclean;</hi> in which case Washing was prescribed by the Law. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Cleansing,</hi> they were not to come to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or to joyn in Gods Worship there. Before God gave the Law at Mount <hi>Sinai, The Lord said to</hi> Moses, <hi>Go unto the People, and sanctifie them to Day, and to Morrow, and let them wash their clothes,</hi> Exod 19.10. From this precept (says <hi>Ainsworth</hi>) the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors gather their Doctrine and <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of baptizing</hi> all whom they admit to their Church and Covenant. But if they had reason to suppose the Heathen <hi>Legally unclean,</hi> as consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how many ways that might come about, and how they had Lived before while Heathen, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:34554:208"/>any care to keep themselves clean that way; it was an hundred to one, that any Proselyte that came and offered himself, had some <hi>uncleanness on</hi> him: and considering that the <hi>unclean were unclean for ever</hi> (and in many cases also defiled other things and persons) till they were cleansed; if there was one Law for them of the Congregation of <hi>Israel,</hi> and for any <hi>stranger,</hi> that should joyn himself to them, (as <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.15.) there would seem to have been <hi>sufficient Warrant</hi> for this practice of their Washing, or Baptizing Proselytes. Not like the <hi>practice of the Pharisees,</hi> Mark 7.3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who added unto Gods Command for washing in case of Uncleanness, and placed Religion in their <hi>oft Wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> though they had no <hi>Legal uncleanness</hi> on them. But what I have offered here concerning the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantableness of <hi>baptizing Proselytes</hi> at their Admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as supposing them to have been some way Legally unclean, I submit to the censure of better Judgments.</p>
               <p>Indeed, I just now find in Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> [of the baptizing of Infants, <hi>pag.</hi> 473. this passage: <q>And that this Custome of washing new born Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and not any other sort of Purification, was it; that this Baptism of Native <hi>Jews</hi> and Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes reserred to, may appear by that which in the <hi>Gemara,</hi> is said of the baptized Proselyte, that he was made [as an Infant new born.]</q> Which if it please our Opposites better, I shall not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with it.</p>
               <p>But that the thing was in use before, <hi>Ainsworth</hi> on <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.12.

                     <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> began his Ministery, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.5, 6. They made question of his person (or his Authority) that did it,

               </p>
               <p>Observe now, as the outward Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in that other Sacrament of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> were taken from the Jewish Passeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. (<hi>Bread and VVine</hi> being constant appendants to it, and one Cup used at the Pascal Supper, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, The <hi>Cup of blessing;</hi> which Expression the Apostle useth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16.) So concerning the <hi>Initiatory Sacrament</hi> of Baptism, what was a Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Rite before, Christ setteth his <hi>Royal stamp</hi> upon, and advanceth to a Gospel-Ordinance: That by his Institution, it becomes the Sacrament of admission in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Gospel-covenant, &amp; into the Christian Church.</p>
               <p>And hence there was no such need for the express <hi>mentioning of Infants,</hi> supposing Christ would have them baptized, as for the express excepting of Infants, supposing Christ would not have them baptized; because as Doctor <hi>Lightfoot</hi> hath well noted:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Harm. of New Test.</hi> sect. 9. p. 10.</note> The <hi>baptizing of Infants</hi> had been a thing ordinarily practised in the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> before. It was enough to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that Christ <hi>established baptism,</hi> as an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance under the Gospel; and then, who should be baptized, was well enough known <hi>by the use</hi> of it before. He further addeth, our Saviour would have given some special Prohibition, if he intended that they should have been excluded.</p>
               <p>Others I know there are, that would have Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism refer to that washing of New-born Infants inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.4. Or to that baptizing of the
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:34554:209"/>
                  <hi>Israelites under the Cloud,</hi> and in the Sea, spoken of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1, 2. Yet in neither of these respects are <hi>Infants</hi> to be excluded from Baptism, unless Christ had excepted them. Questionless there were <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants</hi> among the <hi>Israelites,</hi> baptized in the Cloud, and in the Sea.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another Text plainly proving what I last laid down, as <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39. <hi>Be baptized every one of you. For the promise is to you, and to your Children.</hi> I made use of this Text before, to prove that Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are <hi>within the Covenant</hi> still. And now I make use of it, to prove that being within the Covenant, they have a <hi>right to Baptism,</hi> the Initiating Seal of the Covenant. Those to whom the Promise here spoken of belongeth, to them <hi>Baptism</hi> belongeth: But the Promise belongeth to Children, therefore Baptism belongeth to Children. What the Apostle saith here, is as much as if he had said, Be <hi>baptized you,</hi> and <hi>your Children:</hi> For the Promise is <hi>to you,</hi> and to <hi>your Children.</hi> If there be any force in this reason for the baptizing of the Parents, it argueth as strongly for the <hi>baptizing of their Children.</hi> And if any of this great company had Children with them, we have no reason to doubt, but they were <hi>baptized</hi> with them: Because he says, <hi>Be baptized every one of you; for the Promise is to you, and to your Children.</hi> If because the Promise was to the Parents, they were to be baptized for the <hi>same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> the Children are to be baptized, the Promise being also to them. Are not they sadly blinded with prejudice, that cannot see here, that such as have a <hi>right to the Promise,</hi> have a right to the <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory Seal</hi> of the Promise? And they that have right to the Promise, are not adult persons only, but <hi>Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Children.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="409" facs="tcp:34554:209"/>
               <p n="3">3. I may add <hi>Ex abundanti,</hi> that there wanteth not probable proof, and Testimony in Scripture, that <hi>Infants,</hi> or <hi>young Children</hi> were baptized: When we read of so many whole Housholds bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, it is improbable that there should not be any <hi>young</hi> Child in any of them. And was it not likely to prove of dangerous consequence, to relate the baptizing of <hi>whole Families,</hi> (which does so clearly point at the former practice of Proselyting the whole Family, when the Head and Governour of the Family came to be Proselyted,) if <hi>any part</hi> of the Family (as young Children ordinarily are a part) be uncapable of Baptism now. It is strange that we should be told of <hi>Housholds baptized</hi> again and again; which according to the ordinary phrase and practice among the <hi>Jews,</hi> used to signifie the <hi>Heads of the Family,</hi> and all under them, even <hi>little ones.</hi> (As is shewed before.) It is very strange I say, if it be an Error now to baptize Infants, that the Scripture should tell us oft of <hi>Families baptized,</hi> and not give one Instance of an Houshold baptized, all but their <hi>little ones.</hi> When it was promised of old, that all the <hi>Families of the Earth</hi> should be blessed in Christ; and when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> tell the Jaylor: <hi>Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy House,</hi> (Acts 16.31.) With which may be compared that speech of our Savour to <hi>Zacheus, Luke</hi> 19.9. <hi>This day is Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion come to this House; forasmuch as he also is the Son of Abraham.</hi> And when further we find, that upon a persons receiving the Faith, having the Charge and Government of a Family; that person, and his, or her <hi>Family,</hi> were baptized together: What Impartial, Unprejudiced mind would not
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:34554:210"/>hence conclude, that the Covenant, and <hi>Initiating Seal,</hi> extended to Parents and Children still under the Gospel, as before. You read of <hi>Lydia's</hi> hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold baptized, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.15. and <hi>ver.</hi> 33. That the Jaylor was baptized, and <hi>all his,</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>filii ejus,</hi> (as some) his Children. Or if <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> should not be restrained to Children only, yet it must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily <hi>comprehend Children</hi> (if he had Children.) And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.16. The Houshold of <hi>Stephanas</hi> was baptized. And <hi>Acts</hi> 18.8. When we read that <hi>Crispus,</hi> the chief Ruler of the Synagogue, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on the Lord <hi>with all his House:</hi> And many of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> hearing, believed, and were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. Though I know some would alledge this Text for the baptizing of such only as are <hi>actual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers;</hi> yet being narrowly looked into, it may be found to reach further. As when we read only that <hi>Crispus believed with</hi> all his House, in the former part of the <hi>verse;</hi> yet we are to understand that <hi>Crispus,</hi> with all his Houshold, were <hi>baptized.</hi> We are to supply the word [Baptized] used in the end of the <hi>verse.</hi> And when it is only said in the later part of the <hi>verse,</hi> that many of the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> hearing, <hi>believed,</hi> and were <hi>baptized;</hi> yet we may very well think the word [Houshold] is to be supplied here from the former part of the <hi>verse.</hi> We have no reason to think, that the Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of <hi>Crispus,</hi> was the only Houshold baptized among these believing <hi>Corinthians.</hi> The full sence of this place. therefore seemeth to be this, that <hi>Crispus believed with all his Houshold, and were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, with all his Houshold:</hi> and many of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> hearing, believed and were baptized with their Housholds; so taking in their Children, even
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:34554:210"/>little ones: As it is no way probable, that there should be no <hi>little ones</hi> in any of their Families Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with compare what the Apostle saith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Else were your Children unclean, but now they are Holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now methinks there is something in it, that the Scripture mentioneth <hi>divers housholds</hi> being bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, without excepting the <hi>little ones</hi> in any one houshold baptized, and it is very strange, if none of those housholds had little ones in it.</p>
               <p>Though some will argue from <hi>Act.</hi> 16.32. <hi>They spake unto him the Word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.</hi> It may mean no more, than that they preached to all in the house, that were <hi>capable of hearing</hi> the Word taught. So when <hi>Jacob</hi> said to his Houshold, and to <hi>all</hi> that <hi>were with</hi> him, <hi>Put away the strange Gods that are among you, and be clean,</hi> Gen. 35.2. This will not prove, that there were no <hi>little ones</hi> of his houshold with him. And yet further, they might be said to speak to all that were in the house <hi>in a sence,</hi> to which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not a stranger, the Jailour being bound to teach those things to the <hi>least in his house,</hi> as soon as they should be of capacity to understand. Surely, there is as <hi>strange an expression, Hos.</hi> 12.4. <hi>He found him in Bethel, and there he [spake with us.]</hi> And see <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.1, 2, 10, 11. &amp; <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.1, 12. Again, it is further objected, that <hi>v.</hi> 34. it is said, the Jailour rejoyced, <hi>believing in God with all his house.</hi> As the like is said of those <hi>Corinthians,</hi> Act. 18.8. <hi>Many of the Corinthians hearing, believed, and were baptized.</hi>

               <pb n="412" facs="tcp:34554:211"/>

                  <q>The children of those that believed, must come in under the <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>Believers</hi> too, or they must famish (or be cast upon others.) If the <hi>community of goods</hi> reach't them as well as their Parents, the title <hi>[Believers,]</hi> must reach them too.</q>

               <p>Thus I hope sufficient Scripture warrant hath been produced for Infant-baptism. Many things I have praetermitted, because I would cut this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course as short, as I well may. Yet before I pass from this point, I shall take notice of the chief Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections made against it, because it may tend to your further satisfaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. We have neither <hi>express Precept</hi> nor <hi>Example</hi> in Scripture for the baptizing of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. A <hi>virtual Command</hi> there is in the Gospel for Baptizing of Infants. The Infants of discipled Nations ought to be baptized, as appears from what hath been said. It is implyed in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. Now a virtual Command
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:34554:211"/>is equivalent to an <hi>express command.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And when Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> (the most learned Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Anabaptists have) grants <hi>Baptism in use,</hi> even before <hi>John Baptists</hi> time, in the admission of Proselytes, the New Testament mentioning <hi>whole housholds</hi> that were baptized (never excepting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, or little ones) we have reason to think, that as the Children of the Proselytes were baptized be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, so the children of the Christians were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed too.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What express Precept or Example can the Objectors shew for <hi>Christian Magistrates</hi> in the New Testament? And must all Christian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates therefore be discarded? Again, what express Precept for the <hi>Christian Sabbath?</hi> Whereupon some Anabaptists have returned to the Jewish Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday-Sabbath. Again, what express Precept for Womens receiving the Lords Supper? In 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. it is, <hi>Let a Man examine himself?</hi> Where though the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> be of the common Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and used both for Man and Woman, yet <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Word that follows, is of the Masculine gender, it is <hi>himself,</hi> not <hi>her self.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, to speak <hi>ad hominem,</hi> let one that objects against us the want of express Precept and Example for <hi>Infant-Baptism,</hi> shew us, where he finds any such Precept or Example for the <hi>se-Baptists,</hi> that persons unbaptized should baptize themselves, as they do in the first setting up of their way.</p>
               <p>Again, where do they find either Precept, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in all the New Testament for Christians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring their <hi>childrens Baptism,</hi> till they come to an adult age? Thus the Objection falleth foul upon themselves.</p>
               <pb n="414" facs="tcp:34554:212"/>
               <p>Certainly, there is a <hi>total silence</hi> in Scripture concerning the Children of those that were Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, not one tittle there of any <hi>Christians child</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Baptism delayed, till it came also to make a personal profession. No doubt but many of those who were converted to the Christian Faith by the Apostles, had <hi>little ones,</hi> who either were baptized upon their Parents embracing the Faith, or it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be known <hi>at what age</hi> any of them were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and consequently we cannot tell at what age the Children of Believers now are to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</p>
               <p>Now certainly, this is a <hi>weighty</hi> Case, and I wish that they who seem so desirous to keep close to <hi>Scripture-Rule,</hi> would seriously consider it. They that are only for the baptizing of <hi>adult</hi> persons can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give a Scripture-Instance of <hi>one child born of believing Parents,</hi> whose baptism was deferred till it came to be adult. And besides, this would cross another Rule, that all who are <hi>discipled,</hi> as soon as they are discipled, are to be <hi>baptized.</hi> It is true, that they and we differ concerning the Subject, who are discipled; we holding that the Infants of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are <hi>discipled,</hi> (belonging to the Church, the School of Christ, and the Parents being bound by the Covenant to train them up in <hi>the knowledge of Christ,</hi> and they bound to receive Instruction, as they come to be of any capacity;) but our Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites holding none to be <hi>discipled,</hi> till they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in the Principles of Christianity, and make a personal Profession. Now suppose that they were <hi>in the right</hi> here, that none were Discipled, and to be baptized but upon a personal Profession; yet since it is evident, both from <hi>Christs commission,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:34554:212"/>Matth.</hi> 28. and from all those <hi>Examples</hi> of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons baptized, upon Record in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that as soon as any are discipled, they are <hi>presently</hi> to be <hi>baptized.</hi> I would fain know how they either do, or can follow Scripture-Rule in baptizing the Children of Christian Parents, many years (it may be) after they were Disciples in their own sence; that is, made a <hi>personal profession.</hi> We could give many Instances of little Children, who have been Religiously Educated, Children of Five or <hi>Six years age,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>See Mr.</hi> Whites <hi>little Book for little Children.</hi>
                  </note> that have not only made a profession, but given great Signs and <hi>Evidences</hi> of Grace. And should not such be owned as Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples? And then why not other Children of that age that can give as <hi>good an account,</hi> as may be expected from those Years? And did not Christ, and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles admit all to Baptism, who made but the least <hi>visible profession?</hi> Where do we find any rejected? If now they will not admit persons upon making the least <hi>visible profession,</hi> but Demur them, till they have arrived a <hi>Degree higher;</hi> why may they not defer their baptism, till they are got one degree higher than that, and so <hi>in Infinitum?</hi> And how will they observe Scripture-rule, which is clearly for the baptizing of persons, as soon as they become Disciples? If I was of <hi>their Opinion,</hi> that the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of the Infants of professed Christians, was against Rule, and a Nullity; I must seriously pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, I should be <hi>altogether at a loss,</hi> and not know when to baptize the Children of such. If they must be baptized so soon as they make a visible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, I would fain be informed from Scripture, at what age they may make such a visible profession,
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:34554:213"/>which ought to be taken for their <hi>admission to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this surther, whereas those whom they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptize, were many of them <hi>Religiously Educated,</hi> and seemed to have a love to Religion from their Childhood, and were acquainting themselves with the principles of Religion; I would fain know, whether they will say they only <hi>began to make a profession,</hi> when they first owned Anabaptism? Or if they were professors of Christianity before, and so ought to have submitted to the Sign, and <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Entrance,</hi> and admission amongst Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, whether it was not a great sin against <hi>the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-rule,</hi> that they did not submit to their baptism before? And then I ask, From what time, for how long they are to charge this sinful Omission upon themselves?</p>
               <p>Now compare their way, and ours, and Judge Impartially, which is most agreeable to <hi>Scripture-Rule.</hi> VVe are not for the baptizing of Heathens, or any without the Church, without their having the <hi>Gospel first Preached</hi> to them, and their profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to believe it. Now when they receive the Gospel, they receive it not only for themselves, but for their Children; and were bound to Instruct, and Educate their Children according to it. And so such Families were Discipled, and to be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; and what Children they might have after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to be baptized, as all of them belonging to the Church, and <hi>School of Christ,</hi> to be Trained up in the Knowledge of Christ. And so all along God had <hi>put a Distinction</hi> betwixt the Seed of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing People, and the Children of such as were without the Church: Not only the <hi>Natural seed</hi>
                  <pb n="417" facs="tcp:34554:213"/>of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but the Seed of the Proselytes, that joyned themselves to the Lord, had the Sign of the Covenant. Thus the way is clear to us, whom, and when to baptize.</p>
               <p>Our Opposites are not for the baptizing of the Children of Christians, but upon their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal profession. Now that baptism is not <hi>unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to be deferred,</hi> after one comes to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, they must grant. But how soon, or how long before a <hi>Childs profession,</hi> is to be accounted such, as entitleth him to baptism; they cannot shew from any Command, or Example in the VVord. Here they have <hi>no Rule,</hi> as much as they seem to be for keeping close to Scripture-Rule.</p>
               <p>Now think of it seriously, whether it be at all Credible, that if God would not have the Children of Christians baptized, but upon their <hi>first making</hi> a visible profession, there should yet be no Rule, or Direction, when that might be. VVe can <hi>easily discern,</hi> when such as were Heathens come first to a profession of Christianity: but when a Child of Christian Parents that hath been Learning the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Christianity from his very Infancy, I say, when such a Child shall be taken first to make a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal profession, is no easie matter to determine. Now when the most that they baptize, are such, as they cannot say, when they <hi>first came</hi> to make a personal profession, let any that are Impartial judge, how well they follow Scripture-Rule. Besides, since they must hold, that to baptize a Child before its making a personal profession, would make such baptism a <hi>Nullity;</hi> and to defer to baptize it, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it has come to make a personal profession, is a <hi>sinful neglect,</hi> and plain breach of Gospel-Rule,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:34554:214"/>and Order; and one man may take that for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal profession, which another would not admit to be so: Hereupon it must needs follow, that their way layeth a <hi>certain ground</hi> of Clashing and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion in the Church, and tends to lead both Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and Christians into endless perplexities, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the first admission of our Children.</p>
               <p>Thus you see in this first <hi>grand Objection,</hi> that we have neither express Precept, nor Example for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptism; they are like a man that <hi>rolleth a stone, which returneth upon him</hi> that rolleth it. The Objection returns, and falls heavily on themselves. There is no need of an <hi>express Precept,</hi> or Example for the baptizing of Infants born within the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, this being suitable to the <hi>Scripture-way</hi> before, (as from the time that God had appointed an Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating Seal of the Covenant, the Infants of Parents within the Covenant, were ever before admitted to the <hi>Initiating Seal</hi> with their Parents.) But there is need of express Direction, Rule, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, if such Children are not to be admitted now, but upon their <hi>personal profession,</hi> to shew, when such profession hath been, or may be taken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But further they will Object, that they can shew both Precept and Examples against Infant-baptism.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Precept, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go teach all Nations, baptizing them.</hi> They must be Taught before they are to be baptized: To which agrees, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16, <hi>He that believeth, and is baptized, shall be saved.</hi> A Rule for believers baptism. Infants are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being Taught, are not Actual believers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. As Learning, and <hi>believing</hi> (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that Dispensation) was required of <hi>adult
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:34554:214"/>persons</hi> at the first Institution of Circumcision. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> servants that were to be Circumcised, as well as he, were such as he had <hi>Taught the way</hi> of the Lord, see <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19. And afterwards none could be Proselytes of the Covenant, and taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Jewish Church,</hi> none that were of years, but they must first know, and acknowledge the God of <hi>Israel.</hi> Yet all this hindred not the Circumcising of their Infants. So in <hi>constituting the Gospel-Church,</hi> they that were of Years, must first know, and profess the Name of Christ, before they could be admitted as Members of the Church, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Christians. But this hinders not, but that the Parents being Discipled, their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were to be acknowledged, as belonging to the Church with their Parents. At the first Institution of Baptism, and first Constituting of the Gospel-Church; it was necessary indeed that the first Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, and first Subjects of Baptism, were taught and brought to profess the Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were baptized, (the <hi>Gentiles</hi> being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally strangers to the Covenant, and the <hi>Jews</hi> stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to this new Dispensation of it, and none have <hi>right to Baptism,</hi> the Initiating Seal of the Gospel-Covenant, till they come within the Gospel-Covenant.) And therefore Infants could not be the <hi>first Subjects</hi> of Baptism, because it was necessary their Parents should be in Covenant, to bring them within the Covenant; so the Parents should be first Baptized, as their right to Baptism in <hi>order of Nature,</hi> preceded the right of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. But because the Parents were not admitted to Baptism, but upon their being Taught, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a personal profession, (which was necessary to
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:34554:215"/>bring them <hi>within the Covenant</hi>) it will not follow that their Children must be first Taught, and make a personal profession before they may be baptized. These being now <hi>in Covenant</hi> together with their Parents, have also a right to the Initiating Seal of the Covenant, as well as their Parents. Thus the Baptism of such adult persons, and of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants is but one, and the Ground or Reason of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing both, is one and the same; to wit, their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken into Covenant. Only the <hi>way of adult</hi> persons being taken into Covenant, is diverse from that of their Infants. When persons come to make a profession of Faith in Christ, they are taken (at least, Externally) into Covenant, though they were not <hi>born of believing</hi> Parents; and such as are the Children of believing Parents are (at least Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally) in the Covenant, though they are not at present, capable of being Taught, or of making a personal profession.

                  <hi>Baxter</hi> urgeth from <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10. They upon whose Necks the false Teachers would have put the Yoke of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, are there called <hi>Disciples.</hi> But the false Teachers would have put this Yoke, not only upon Christian Parents, but upon their Children and Infants. It plainly appears from <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 5, 24. that <hi>Circumcision</hi> was the <hi>Yoke</hi> there spoken of. And it is out of question, that there were more young Children than adult persons, upon whom those false Teachers would have brought this <hi>Yoke.</hi> And since this Scripture only declares against their lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Yoke upon the Neck of the Disciples, it follows, that either the Children, and Infants of Disciples are included in this term <hi>[Disciples]</hi> or that the Circumcising of such was not forbidden here; but only the Imposing of Circumcision upon adult persons.</p>
               <p>Neither should it seem strange, that Children, Infants, are called Disciples, being admitted into the <hi>School of Christ,</hi> and to be Trained up in the Knowledge of Christ. Sometimes we send our Children to School, before they can <hi>Learn of a book,</hi> and such are numbered among the Scholars, being designed for Learning, as soon as they are capable. And it is not so strange, that such as are intended for Learning, and entred into a School, should be called <hi>Scholars,</hi> before they have Learnt any thing; as that none should be accounted Christs Scholars, or Disciples, till they have made so great <hi>proficiency</hi> (as some would have it) that they can give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Conversion, of the Work of Grace being wrought in them; of the time when, and
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:34554:216"/>manner how it was wrought: Scholars are entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a School, not because they are already Taught, but that they may be Taught. And <hi>Timothy</hi> was Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Holy Scriptures <gap reason="foreign">

That it is certain from Child-little, he was a <hi>Desciple of Christ.</hi> This which is Recorded of <hi>Timothy,</hi> should Teach all Christians, that have Children, to begin with them <hi>betimes,</hi> to teach them to know God, and his Will. The things of God cannot be <hi>Learnt too soon,</hi> neither are little Children uncapable Subjects of Divine Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Grace. But that Christian Parents are bound to <hi>Instruct</hi> their Children in the Doctrine of Christianity, and to Teach them their Duty, as soon as ever they are capable of receiving such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, and that Children ought to attend to such Instruction; Would not this imply that they are <hi>Disciples?</hi> But indeed they that are against In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants Discipleship and baptism, have been general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against the Instructing and Catechizing of Little ones. If some of them of late go not so far in their Opposition, I am glad of it.</p>
               <p>Yet further, Is it not as strange, that little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and Infants, should be called <hi>Servants,</hi> as that they should be called <hi>Disciples?</hi> Yet such are called <hi>Servants, Lev.</hi> 25.41, 42. The Children of the poor <hi>Israelite</hi> (of what age soever) are there called <hi>Gods Servants.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> professeth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 116.16. <hi>O Lord, truly I am thy Servant, I am thy Servant, the Son of thy Hand-maid.</hi> (i. e.) <hi>born thy Servant</hi> in thy House, as <hi>Ainsworth</hi> says. So <hi>Psal.</hi> 86.16. <hi>David</hi> was born a Servant of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Suppose we could not prove, Infants included
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:34554:216"/>in the Commission, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. (as hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved already) yet that they are not expresly menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned here as <hi>Subjects of baptism,</hi> is not enough to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them, unless there were no other <hi>Scripture-Rule</hi> but this, to direct us about it, who are to be baptized. As because this Commission was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly directed to the Apostles <hi>only,</hi> to the Eleven, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. It will not follow that they only were au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized to baptize.</p>
               <p>Now I come to consider that other Text, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. which some I know build most upon. <hi>[He that believeth, and is baptized, shall be saved.]</hi> The Scope whereof is to shew, who alone partake of the saving benefit of baptism, (and other Gospel-Ordinances) <hi>being adult.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Whiston <hi>of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Baptism.</hi> p. 295.</note> Or (as one says) Here Christ informs them what the <hi>Issue</hi> of the Execution of their Commission should be.— Those that should <hi>believe,</hi> and be <hi>baptized,</hi> should be saved; but those that believed not, (however they might be baptized, yet) they should be damned. But that there is <hi>no colour</hi> for making this Text the Rule of baptizing; or for any to suppose, that it determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth who are the <hi>only lawful Subjects</hi> of baptism; is evident (I think) from these following parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p n="1">1, That it is not said, <hi>[He that believeth only, shall be baptized.]</hi> But, <hi>[He that believeth, and is baptized, shall be saved.] He that believeth, and is baptized,</hi> is the <hi>Subject</hi> in this Proposition, of whom this is predicated, that <hi>[He shall be saved.]</hi> Hence it is manifest, that these words hold forth the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Salvation, not the subject of <hi>baptism.</hi> Yet we must not say, they determine the <hi>only subject
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:34554:217"/>of Salvation,</hi> unless we will hold baptism of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute necessity to Salvation, and hold that no Infant (that does not actually believe) can be saved.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That in the Opposite Member, it is not said, [He that believeth not, shall not be baptized.] but, [He that believeth not, shall be damned.]</p>
               <p n="3">3. If this Text should be taken to determine the <hi>only lawful Subjects</hi> of baptism, then it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the Apostles, and their assistants, were guilty of <hi>Male-administration,</hi> and Erred in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing many, (such as <hi>Annanias, Saphira, Simon Magus,</hi> &amp;c.) who were not <hi>believers,</hi> in the sence of this Text: Either such had a right to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ordinance, or not. If they had <hi>no right</hi> to it, then it was amiss for any (were they Apostles themselves) to admit them to baptism, who had <hi>no right</hi> to it. If they had a right to the outward Ordinance, then [He that believeth, and is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] Doth not determine the <hi>only lawful Subject</hi> of baptism; diverse having been rightfully baptized, who were not true believers, such as this Text speaks of.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If believers baptism, be the only lawful baptism (in the sence that believing is here used) then how is it possible for any Minister to dispose this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in Faith? He cannot baptize others but <hi>doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,</hi> of whose unfeigned Faith, he is not assured. And he cannot be assured, that anothers Faith is true and saving, without <hi>Special Revelation.</hi> And thus without Special Revelation he should not know who may lawfully be baptized.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If this Text concludes against Infants baptism, it concludes as well against the <hi>Salvation of Infants.</hi>
                  <pb n="425" facs="tcp:34554:217"/>If you say, They believe not, and therefore are not to be baptized; it followeth <hi>more directly</hi> from the next words, They believe not, therefore they shall be Damned. If now to avoid so <hi>horrid a consequence,</hi> as that all Infants are Damned, you will have the Text Restrained to the adult, as needs it must be; you take away the force of the Argument hence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Baptizing of Infants.</hi> As more is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of adult persons, than of Infants, <hi>in order to Salvation;</hi> So that may be required in order to the baptizing of the adult, which is not required of Infants. And yet I must mind you, that this Scripture does not determine, who only of the adult ought to be baptized; but who only of the adult enjoy the saving benefit of that, as of other Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Ordinances. Other things I pass by for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity-sake.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) They bring diverse Examples as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, against Infant-baptism. As the Example of the Three Thousands, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 41. And of the <hi>Samaritans Act.</hi> 8.12. And of the Eunuch there, <hi>ver.</hi> 36, 37, 38. And of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and those that were with him, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.47, 48.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Note here, that the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who would have baptism a <hi>Temporary Rite,</hi> do in like manner argue from these Instances, that we only Read of the baptizing of such as were <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the Christian Faith;</hi> not of such as were born in it, and had all along professed it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our reading, that such and such were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized upon the profession of Faith and Repentance, and the like, will not prove, that <hi>such only</hi> were baptized.</p>
               <p>The profession of Faith and Repentance might
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:34554:218"/>well be required of adult persons <hi>in order to baptism,</hi> and yet the Children of such as made a profession, be baptized without it. As God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired <hi>Abraham</hi> to walk before him in sincerity, <hi>[Walk before me, and be thou perfect. And I will make my Covenant between me and thee,]</hi> Gen. 17.1, 2. Yet this did not hinder the Covenant being made with his Seed, when they could not so walk before God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If those words, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. <hi>[Repent, and be baptized.— For the Remission of sins.]</hi> Must be so taken, as excluding Infants from Baptism, they must then be understood also to deny to Infants the Remission of sin.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If we may argue from <hi>Act.</hi> 8.37. <hi>Exclusive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> that none but such as believe with the heart, are to be baptized; this Text would make against our Opposites as well: those that Object it against us, will they say, they baptize none, but such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve with all their heart?</p>
               <p n="5">5. So if <hi>Act.</hi> 10.47. must be so taken, as if none were to be baptized, but such as had <hi>received the Holy Ghost,</hi> as those had done; they themselves should be Excluded from Baptism, till it appears, that the <hi>Gift of the Holy Ghost</hi> is poured on them, that they speak with Tongues, as these did, <hi>ver.</hi> 45, 46. Indeed as the Gift of the Holy Ghost was <hi>an Evidence</hi> of their being taken within the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Covenant, (see <hi>Mark</hi> 16.17.) and so a ground for the baptizing of them: It will follow, that whosoever can be proved to be <hi>within the Covenant,</hi> have a right to baptism. And this will also plead for the admission of the Children of believers to baptism, we having seen it proved, that they are within the Covenant.</p>
               <pb n="427" facs="tcp:34554:218"/>
               <p n="6">6. Sometimes we find, upon the Personal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the Head of a Family, the <hi>whole Houshold</hi> to have been <hi>straightway</hi> baptized. And therefore they that tell you, the Apostles baptized none but such as made a Personal profession of Faith, and Repentance, speak quite <hi>beside the Book,</hi> say more than they can prove. Turn to <hi>Act.</hi> 16, 14, 15. There you will find <hi>Lydia, and her Houshold</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; where no mention is made of any one in the Family being wrought upon, but only <hi>Lydia</hi> her self, Methinks it is observable what one hath No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:

                  <q>How the Holy Ghost doth <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry his manner of Expression</hi> here, when he speaks of the baptism of Housholds; he tells us, the Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds were baptized together with their Parents; not giving the <hi>least Intimation</hi> of the Faith of any besides, in, or of those Houses, as the ground of their Baptism, but when he speaks of more <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Assemblies,</hi> or Concourses of People; he speaks more Distinguishingly: <hi>[As many as gladly received the Word, were baptized,</hi> Acts 2.41.]</q> And why the Holy Ghost should speak so <hi>distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishingly</hi> in one place, and not in the other, is hard to say; unless it should be, because in respect of such more General Assemblies, and Concourses of People, consisting of Grown Persons; the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Faith of each was necessary to their Baptism, but not so in respect of the Houses of believing Parents.</p>
               <p>Further, Some urge the Example of Christ, who was not Baptized till he was Thirty Years Old.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. What? Would they have had him

               <p n="2">2. How well do they <hi>follow Christs</hi> Example, who are for baptizing persons at half Thirty Years Age?</p>
               <p n="3">3. And the reason of Christs not being Baptized till he was about Thirty Years old, could not be to Teach that none are to be <hi>admitted to baptism,</hi> till they can make a personal profession. Certainly, Christ had for a long time before, made a Personal profession. He being a Child was filled with Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the Grace of God was upon him, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.40. And when he was but <hi>Twelve Years Old,</hi> he was able to Dispute with the most Learned Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, to the astonishing of all that heard him, <hi>ver.</hi> 42, 46, 47.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This Example, that Christ went to <hi>John</hi> to be Baptized of him, rather makes against their <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists.</hi> And the first of their way, baptize them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Surely, they cannot plead Christs Example for this Practice.</p>
               <p>So, some urge the Example of the <hi>Romans, Rom.</hi> 6.3. Of the <hi>Galatians, Gal.</hi> 3.27. Of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lossians, Col.</hi> 2.12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is certain, all the baptized <hi>Romans, Galatians, Colossians,</hi> had not Savingly and Really put on Christ, neither were Really buried with Christ; but only <hi>Sacramentally</hi> many of them. And thus in infant-baptism there is a putting on Christ, and a being buried with Christ; some being <hi>really Ingrafted</hi> into him, and really partaking of the Fruits of his Death; and all being under an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, as they shall grow up, to put on Christ, and to Conform themselves to the Death, and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of Christ.</p>
               <pb n="429" facs="tcp:34554:219"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 3. Another great Objection against In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptism, is that it Frustrates the ends of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, is Unprofitable and Vain; Infants being Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of Understanding, or Improving it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Here that is a sure Rule,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Instit.</hi> l. 4. c. 16. sect, 20.</note> which <hi>Calvin</hi> lays down: <hi>Quaecunque ad qualifaciendam Circumcisionem ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumenta inclinant, vim nullam habent in oppugnando Baptismo.</hi> Those arguments which would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw Infant-Circumcision, (which was an undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Ordinance of God) cannot be Valid against Infant-baptism. There were <hi>Spiritual, and Holy ends of</hi> Circumcision, and adult persons were to make that use of their Circumcision, which an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant could not make of it. Now shall any hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on deny, that the <hi>Circumcision of Infants</hi> was an Ordinance of God, or deny the Wisdom of God in appointing it? Since it is Obvious, that what is Objected here against Infant-baptism, may as well be turned against Infant-Circumcision: May we not say, to any such Objector, as the Apostle (in another sence) <hi>Nay but, O man, who art thou that disputest against God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Of all those Seven ends of Baptism, which <hi>H. D.</hi> lays down: I would fain know which, or how many of them agreed unto Christs own bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism. Was his baptism to witness his Repentance, who had no sin to repent of? Or was it to evidence his present Regeneration, who was Gods holy One from the birth, and from the Conception? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Did all those Ends agree to the baptism of <hi>Simon Magus, &amp;c.</hi> Did the baptism of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> witness his Repentance, and Evidence his present Regeneration? Or declare his being bur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> with Christ? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="430" facs="tcp:34554:220"/>
               <p n="4">4. Since baptism is acknowledged a Sign of Gods Covenant, and of entrance into the Church, and the Infant-Children of believers are within the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and of the Church (as hath been sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved) in these respects baptism doth belong to such Infants, as well as it would to others adult, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their embracing the Christian Faith, and making a profession. Where the same thing hath several respects, it may agree to one in one respect, and to others in other respects.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Regeneration,</hi> and <hi>Remission</hi> of sin (which is the Inward Baptism) are things that Infants are not uncapable of, if they be not uncapable of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Why then should they be thought uncapable of the Outward baptism, the Sign thereof?</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Fruit, and benefit of this Ordinance of baptism, is not restrained to the very <hi>Time</hi> of the Administration of it; but may come in afterwards. Yea, that baptism received in Infancy, is of use through ones whole course.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Yea, in some respects it hath its special uses and advantages, even above that in adult Estate. To name a few particulars here.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As the Child baptized is a <hi>declared Member</hi> of the Visible Church of Christ, and so especially Interested
<note n="*" place="margin">I mean, above others who are yet without the Church.</note> in the Churches Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, even <hi>before it can</hi> pray for it self. Certainly, to have a share in the Prayers of all Gods People, is no mean Priviledge. When <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham prayed for Ishmael,</hi> though he was not the Son of the Promise; yet, <hi>As for Ishmael, I have heard thee,</hi> (says God, Gen. 17.20.) <hi>Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him Fruitful.</hi> That he
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:34554:220"/>fared some way better for <hi>Abrahams</hi> prayer. Though the Church of God out of <hi>common Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> prays for all men; yet more especially for her Members, for whom she can plead Gods Covenant. And thus Infants by their baptism being declared Members of the Church, and within the Covenant, are in a greater probability of <hi>reaping benefit</hi> by the Prayers of Gods People, than if they are supposed to be without the Covenant.</p>
               <p>So likewise upon our Principles, Christian Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents have <hi>stronger Pleas</hi> to urge with God in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, on the behalf of their Children, than they of contrary Principles can have. They can pray for their Children, only as they may <hi>pray for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> while they suppose them out of the Covenant. Now see the difference of these two States, <hi>Isa.</hi> 63.19. <hi>We are thine,— they are not called by thy Name.</hi> So we can pray for our Children upon better grounds, Lord, bless them, own them, <hi>they are thine.</hi> When our Opposites deny themselves this Plea, and instead of it must pray God to pity them, though <hi>they are not called by his Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Infant-baptism lays a <hi>stronger</hi> Obligation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Parents to bring up their Children in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Nurture, and Admonition of the Lord. And how many have cause to bless God for the <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of</hi> good Education? And how strong a Motive is this, to Excite and Quicken Godly Parents to their Duty, in the Religious Education of their Children, to consider Gods special Interest in them, their solemn devoting of them to his Service, and solemn promise to Train them up for him?</p>
               <p>Yea, many from the meer workings of Natural Conscience, hereupon have shewn some Care, that
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:34554:221"/>their Children might be Instructed in the Principles of Religion, whereby the Knowledge of Christ and Christianity, is further spread.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Infant-baptism also lays a special <hi>Obligation</hi> upon Children, to acquaint themselves with the Terms, and Tenour of that Covenant, their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents have engaged them in. And so it is a <hi>special means</hi> to continue the Covenant-Relation betwixt God, and his Peoples Seed. Parents being here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by obliged to <hi>Catechise,</hi> Instruct Children, and Teach them their Duty, and to bring them to the Means, the Word and Ordinances of Christ; and <hi>Children being obliged</hi> to receive such Instructions, and to attend upon the Word, and Ordinances, and apply themselves to the Service of Christ, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they have been Devoted. And herein Gods <hi>preventing Love</hi> and Mercy towards our Children is seen, that he would not have them <hi>left to their own choice,</hi> whom they would serve, any more than the Seed of his People of Old; and that as they could never have chosen better for themselves, so the sence of their <hi>baptismal Covenant</hi> might prevail with them, as soon as they come to any understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and will of their own, to serve the <hi>God of their Fathers;</hi> to set forward in the good and right Way, wherein they should go, betimes before they are sinfully Habituated in any other Course.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Infant-baptism carrieth in it the clearest Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of our miserable, sinful, and corrupt Estate <hi>by Nature,</hi> and of the need there is (in respect of Original corruption) both of the <hi>Blood of Christ,</hi> to take off the Guilt, and of the <hi>Spirit of Grace,</hi> to free our souls from the power of Corruption. And thus it hath a <hi>direct tendency</hi> towards a deep
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:34554:221"/>Humiliation, and sound Conversion, as soon as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are of Capacity to reflect upon it. If bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism was <hi>only Administred</hi> to persons of adult age, though it denotes thus much, that they are sinful, unclean Creatures (considered in themselves) such as <hi>have need of washing;</hi> yet it would not point at Original Corruption, as Infant-baptism doth; for they might be accounted <hi>sinners by practice,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being acknowledged <hi>sinful by Nature.</hi> As we know, many who have been against Infant-baptism, have denied Original sin.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Infant-baptism is a more visible Character, and Expression of Gods <hi>Free-grace,</hi> the subject being <hi>purely passive.</hi> It may seem strange, that God should this way hold forth his Free-Grace under the Old Testament, providing an Ordinance of which Infants were capable, and make no such provision under the Gospel.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Infant-baptism engageth us against sin, as a <hi>vowed Enemy</hi> for ever.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Israel</hi> was to have War with <hi>Amalek</hi> for ever: So are we ever to resolve, and strive against sin, and seek the utter Extirpation of it. That we were false to Christ, and lived in <hi>the Violation</hi> of our Baptismal Covenant, all that while we served sin: The remembrance and consideration thereof, is a <hi>means to further the Humiliation</hi> of many gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious hearts for sins past, as a means to quicken them to greater watchfulness and resolvedness against sin for the time to come.</p>
               <p>Here methinks it is worth noticing, what one says,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ep. Ded. to Mr.</hi> Fords <hi>practical use of Infant-Baptism.</hi> p. 5.</note>
                  <q>Though it may in some cases be granted, that an Ordinance administred
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:34554:222"/>with some considerable circumstantial <hi>Irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> may sanctifie; yet that those Irregularities themselves should be the <hi>Channels</hi> of Sanctifying Grace, it is not easily imaginable. Now this is the case of Infant-baptism. Many holy men of many Ages, have found their hearts Warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Quickned in the Exercise of Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Love, Thankfulness, restrained from sin, excited to duty, by the consideration (not only of Baptism, and the Personal Covenant therein Sealed, but also) of <hi>Infant-Baptism</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Circumstance, and the Covenant of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors, the Foundation of that Administration.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Infant-baptism affords much Comfort and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to believing Parents, in reference to their seed. It may well rejoyce the heart of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian-Parent, to see his Childes baptism a <hi>token of Gods good Will</hi> towards it, Sealing his Covenant with it. And take away the grounds of Infant-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, and what ground hath a Believer to hope of the salvation of his Child dying in Infancy, more than to hope of the salvation of the Child of any Heathen or Infidel? Infants are not saved upon account of <hi>Native Innocency,</hi> (though they are innocent in respect of Actual Transgression, yet are they Guilty in respect of Natural <hi>inherent Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption</hi>) but Infants that are saved, are saved upon the account of Christ: And if saved by Christ, then Interested in him: And if Interested in him, by what Covenant? I know no other but that, where God promiseth to be the God of a Believer, and of his seed, that can <hi>give us hopes</hi> of the salvation of our Children, dying in Infancy. No other Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that I can find in Scripture, to make over Christ and his saving Benefits to Infants.</p>
               <pb n="435" facs="tcp:34554:222"/>
               <p>But now God promising to be a God to the seed of believers, and sealing this in their Baptism, such of them as die Infants, and so no ways revoke or <hi>violate the</hi> Covenant by any Act or Deed of theirs, we have good ground to conclude that they are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: as Christ said, <hi>Of such is the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> These being in Covenant, and not breaking Covenant with God, it is not to be thought, that God will break Covenant with them.</p>
               <p>Again, hence godly Parents may be encouraged, in reference to their living Issue. Since God hath taken them into Covenant, there is <hi>more hope,</hi> that God may have special Covenant-blessings in store for them, than there is of such as are out of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. And if Parents and Children were Diligent, and Faithful in doing their part, we might see then, it should not stick at Him, the Lord would not fail to do His part. See <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Infant-baptism (engaging the seed of profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Christians to the embracing and professing of Christianity) hath been one great means to enlarge the Visible Church, and Kingdom of Christ. A means to <hi>preserve</hi> the Christian Religion, and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate</hi> it to many, that otherwise were likely never to have come so far, as to an outward owning and profession of it. It is not so easie to draw persons <hi>to a renouncing of Christ</hi> and Christianity, who have been engaged to a Profession of it from their very Infancy; as it would have been to have kept many such <hi>from owning</hi> it at all, had they been left to themselves, till they were grown up, then to chuse for themselves. I hope, there are none of us, so sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, as not to acknowledge it <hi>a priviledge,</hi> to live in a Land, where Christ is generally owned by an
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:34554:223"/>open, outward profession; rather than to Live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>Jews, Turks,</hi> or <hi>Pagans,</hi> that are Enemies to the very Name of Christ.</p>
               <p>You may see more of this Nature in Mr. <hi>Fords,</hi> practical Use of Infant-baptism.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 4. They Object, that Infant-baptism is followed with Mischiefs, attended with very evil Consequences; bringing in false Matter into the Church, and Deforming her with so many Rotten Members, Ignorant, and Scandalous Persons, as many of those prove, who were Baptized in Infancy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. They might with as good Reason bring in the like Charge against Infant-Circumcision. Now would not that be to charge <hi>God foolishly?</hi> And shall <hi>a man be more pure than his Maker?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Were there no Rotten Members among all those whom <hi>John</hi> Baptized? <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. No Rotten Members among them of <hi>Samaria,</hi> Baptized by <hi>Phillip? Acts</hi> 8. No Rotten Members in the Church of <hi>Corinth, Galatia,</hi> and other Churches, we read of planted by the Apostles themselves?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Are there no Rotten Members that they take in? No Hypocrites? None of corrupt Principles?</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Infant-Baptism</hi> is neither a cause of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, nor of Profaneness, but <hi>an Engagement</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all that have been partakers of it, to Learn the Doctrine of Christ, and live according to his Laws. And however Infants may prove afterwards, yet when they are admitted to Baptism, they are free from all culpable Ignorance, not guilty of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, nor to be charged with any Actual sin.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The true cause of these Mischiefs is <hi>Parents neglect</hi> of their Duty, of Instructing and Train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up Children as they ought; or want of the due
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:34554:223"/>Exercise of <hi>Church-Discipline,</hi> and Censures. And so they might be prevented, or removed by other wayes and means, than denying Infant-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.</p>
               <p>And if any that are Parents think they have done enough, in having brought their Children to be Baptized; or any Person thinks, he is a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, because he is baptized, they have not Learnt so of us.</p>
               <p>More I would have said to this, because it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with some well-meaning Souls; but I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther refer you to what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath written of Infant-baptism, <hi>pag.</hi> 117. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 5. They Object, that Baptism being Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred to one in Infancy, he hath no way to be certain, that he was Baptized, but must take it upon trust from others. And in this respect there is more to be said for Infant-Circumcision, because that left a Mark and Character, whereby it might be known, such were Circumcised.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Circumcision was used amongst others, besides the <hi>Jews;</hi> some that were Idolaters, and Heathens, took up this Rite; though to them it was not the Ordinance of Circumcision, or a Sign of Gods Covenant. And it was possible for the <hi>Jews</hi> to be sometimes taken Captive by these, and their Children to be Circumcised with their Mock-Circumcision. Now look how the <hi>Jews</hi> might be satisfied, that they had the true Circumcision, and in the like way our Children may be certified of their Baptism.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How was <hi>Paul</hi> certified, that he was Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised <hi>the eighth day,</hi> Phil. 3.5. Surely, he could not remember it? Only it was so te tified by others,
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:34554:224"/>And the same way may our Children be certified of their Baptism in Infancy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What assurance can they that are Rebaptized have, that their later baptism was right? I suppose the words <hi>[I baptize thee in the Name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,]</hi> are pronounced as they are Plunging into the Water; at which time it is not possible they should hear, and attend to them. How do they know <hi>in whose Name they were baptized?</hi> Must not they also take it upon trust, that they were Baptized <hi>in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost;</hi> which the By-standers sometimes could not hear distinctly.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Why may we not as well be certified of our Baptism in Infancy by a Register, as of our Birth? They that will question what is so Recorded, may as well question their Christian Names, and so feat to claim any Earthly Inheritances, Portions, or Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies under those Names.</p>
               <p>Further, some of them will plead Antiquity: but how vainly and groundlessly, some of ours have shewn.</p>
               <p>I cannot but wonder <hi>H. D.</hi> should make such a Flourish with the Citations he meets with in <hi>The plain and well grounded Treatise concerning Baptism,</hi> (falsly so called) without taking any notice of Mr. <hi>Colbet</hi>'s answer thereunto.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pelagians</hi> (though bold enough, yet) had not so great a stock of Confidence,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>De peccat. Mer. &amp; Remiss.</hi> l. 1. c. 26.</note> (as <hi>Augustine</hi> observes) who never durst deny the baptism of Infants, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they saw, they must too open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have Clashed with the whole Church. Certainly,
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:34554:224"/>if those antient Hereticks could have found any fair pretence from Antiquity to have opposed Infant-baptism, since it would have made so much for their purpose, they would have thought their Labour here well bestowed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Last, One Objection more, that must not be passed by, is, That we have changed the <hi>antient Rite</hi> and Ceremony of <hi>Dipping.</hi> This some make so Essential and Necessary to true Baptism, that they hold our Baptism no more Baptism, than it would have been Circumcision; if instead of Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the Foreskin, they had only pared their Nails.</p>
               <p>Now, 1. They argue for the Necessity of Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, from the Notation of the words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which they will have only to signifie Dipping, or Plunging into Water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> But if it could be proved that the word <hi>[Baptize]</hi> primarily signifieth to <hi>Dip,</hi> Plunge, or Cover all over; yet the Scripture-use of the word is against them. This is plain from Many Texts which are ordinarily produced, <hi>Mark</hi> 7.4. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they wash <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, They Eat not. I hope they do not Imagine, that the <hi>Pharisees</hi> Dipt themselves every time they went to Meat. So the word is used to signifie any way of Washing, and not only that of Dipping. And whereas they use to oppose <hi>[Baptizing]</hi> to Rantizing, or <hi>Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;</hi> yet the Scripture useth them promiscuously: In the Language of the Holy Ghost, <hi>Sprinkling</hi> is sometimes called <hi>Baptism, Heb.</hi> 9.10. We read of diverse Washings, in the <hi>Greek</hi> it is <hi>Baptismes.</hi> Where some of those Washings spoken of, were by way of <hi>Sprinkling, ver.</hi> 13, 19, 21. <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.7.
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:34554:225"/>and 19.17, 18. And whether is more proper to the place, diverse kinds of Dipping, or diverse kinds of Washing and Purifying?</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. But first the Texts of Scripture they bring to prove it, if well looked into, are no cogent Proofs of it. The phrase of bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing

                  <hi>With what</hi> shall it be salted. So we have <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11. Whether is more consonant to Scripture-phrase, to say, he shall <hi>Dip you in</hi> the Spirit; or to say, he shall <hi>Pour the Spirit</hi> on you? So that phrase seemeth to be more against Dipping, than for it. Another Text they urge, is <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.16. Jesus when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: but in the <hi>Greek</hi> it is only <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he went up <hi>[from]</hi> not <hi>[out of]</hi> the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Another Text which they think very consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for their purpose, is <hi>John</hi> 3.23. <hi>John</hi> bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in <hi>Aenon,</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, because many wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were there. The Text proves not the waters of such depth, as was convenient for Dipping; though here was a conveniency, when great Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes came to <hi>John</hi>'s baptism, that he and his Disciples might be employed together. The word <hi>Aenon</hi> signifies no more than <hi>Fonticulus,</hi> a little Spring, or Rivulet. And they tell us, it was a small Brook indeed, which one might almost stride over; though of no small account in that hot Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, where water was so scarce. Another Text they stand much upon, is <hi>Acts</hi> 8.38. which if it will prove, that <hi>Phillip</hi> Dipped the Eunuch, it will prove also that he Dipped himself: For it is said, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <p n="2">2. They have little to say, to those Instances, which some of ours produce of Persons baptized, and no probability <hi>of their</hi> being Dipt. As we read of Three Thousand baptized in a day, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. Yea, in part of a day. (Compare <hi>ver.</hi> 15. with 41.) VVhen so few hands were to be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it would seem passing strange, that they should Dip so many as Three Thousand, taking them one by one, in part of a day, (as one part of the day was spent before the Company met, and a further part of it was spent in <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon, by which they were Converted.) Now had they been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized <hi>in their way,</hi> it would scarce have been the work of a day or two. Again, if they were Dipt, they were either Dipt <hi>Naked,</hi> or in <hi>their Cloaths.</hi> If <hi>Naked,</hi> then they might all have seemed <hi>full of new Wine</hi> indeed. If <hi>Davids</hi> servants were asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, when <hi>Hanun</hi> cut off their Garments to the Middle, (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.4.) What <hi>matter of shame</hi> had it been, if all these had been stript Naked? And what reproach would this have brought upon the way of Christianity? If <hi>in their Cloaths,</hi> such Dipping would have been a Washing of their Cloaths, rather than of themselves. So the Cloaths had been baptized <hi>immediately,</hi> and primarily, and the Body only <hi>consequently,</hi> and secondarily. Thus indeed their Bodies might be wet, but not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly washed. So likewise some parts of the body might have been <hi>untouched,</hi> And then how would such Dipping hold forth a being <hi>Sanctified through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, when <hi>Paul</hi> was weak after three dayes Fasting, <hi>Ananias</hi> comes to him in the House of
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:34554:226"/>
                  <hi>Judas,</hi> and baptized him. And afterwards recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Meat he was strengthened, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.9, 18, 19. What Evidence or <hi>Probability</hi> can they shew, that <hi>Paul</hi> in that weak condition he was in, was taken out to a River, or Plunged into cold water, which might in an ordinary way have destroyed him? The old Rule <hi>[I will have Mercy and not Sacrifice,]</hi> approved by Christ himself, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.7. may sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie us, that either it was not <hi>Pauls</hi> duty <hi>(pro hic &amp; nunc)</hi> to be baptized, or that Plunging the body into water was not then held <hi>indispensibly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,</hi> and essential to Baptism.</p>
               <p>Again, we read, the Jailor and his Houshold were baptized in the Night. Had the Jailor a Pond, or River in his House? Or if he was so well stored with water laid in, as might suffice to Dip or Plung them into; yet would it be <hi>pure enough</hi> for those that came last, when others had been washed in it before? We know sometimes they Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue from that Expression of <hi>[Bodies washed with pure water,]</hi> Heb. 10.22.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Had it been never so clear and manifest, that in those Hotter Countreys, Baptism was Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred in the <hi>way of Dipping;</hi> there is more to be pleaded for it, than for this Practice in such a cold Climate as ours, where it would be to cross other Scripture-Rules. As Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> conceives, that <q>The Practice sprung up in the Hotter Countreys, where Custome had Taught them to go almost half Naked, in comparison of us, and therefore it was there more Civil, or less Immodest, and less Dangerous to their Lives.</q> But what he hath written of this Practice in our Circumstances, <hi>pag.</hi> 134. to 138. deserves to be well weighed. So far
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:34554:227"/>as I am able to judge, he there clearly proves, that our Dippers <hi>break the Commandment of God,</hi> to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their <hi>Tradition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. They argue from the Nature of Baptism, and the <hi>Analogy</hi> and Resemblance betwixt <hi>Dipping,</hi> and <hi>Christs Burial,</hi> or our burial with Christ, held forth in baptism, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. And on this, the wisest of them lay the greatest stress: To overthrow this, is to overthrow their greatest strength.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Whereas one of them makes <hi>Dipping</hi> the <hi>very Form</hi> of Baptism: If it were so, then (for as much as <hi>Forma dat esse rei</hi>) whensoever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are Dipt, (as some are for <hi>Punishment</hi>) or Dip and Douse themselves, (as some do for <hi>Pleasure</hi>) this should be the Ordinance of Baptism, here being the <hi>true Form</hi> of baptism.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is not the <hi>Measure</hi> and <hi>Quantity,</hi> but the <hi>Quality,</hi> or <hi>Ʋse</hi> of water, that is Representative, and Significative (by Christs Institution) in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.</p>
               <p>For my part, I should not dare to make the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Dipping,</hi> or <hi>Sprinkling,</hi> or (which we gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally use) <hi>Pouring on</hi> of water <hi>a Sacramental,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out clearer Evidence of Scripture, than I could ever yet see produced. As in the Lords Supper, Christ hath appointed Bread and VVine, without determining how much of these each Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant should take: So in Baptism, he hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed water to be used (to signifie the <hi>Cleansing virtue</hi> and Efficacy of his Blood and Spirit) without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining the quantity of water, or the manner how it should be applied, whether by Immersion, Aspersion, or Superfusion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If because <hi>Dipping</hi> best Representeth the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:34554:227"/>of Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore we must be for <hi>Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping</hi> upon any Terms, and account that no Baptism, which is not this way Administred; I doubt this way of Arguing hath a Reach, quite beyond the Intention of them that use, and urge it.</p>
               <p>They that are so Zealous for Dipping, to hold forth their <hi>being Buried with Christ,</hi> by a parity of Reason should as well be for <hi>Crossing,</hi> to hold forth their being Crucified with Christ. VVhereas they Insist so much on <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. <hi>We are buried with him by Baptism:</hi> In the two next verses, the Apostle speaks of being Planted together <hi>in the likeness of his Death;</hi> and of the Old Man <hi>being Crucified</hi> with him, (<hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6.) Now might they not from hence Argue as well for <hi>Crossing</hi> all that were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, as holding forth the <hi>likeness of Christs Death</hi> more clearly, than Dipping only doth? Only they should be for Crossing first. and Dipping after that; as the Crucifixion and Death of Christ preceded his Burial, and as men use not to be buried before they are dead. So might not others plead as well for the <hi>White Garment,</hi> as holding forth that Purity and Holiness Christians are called, and obliged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to? So might they not in like manner Argue for the Ministers Breaking and Giving to every Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant a <hi>whole Loaf,</hi> more clearly to hold forth such an ones duty to <hi>take whole Christ,</hi> and the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of very worthy Receiver, that he is Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ested in <hi>whole Christ?</hi> And might they not as well contend for every ones <hi>taking their full of Bread and Wine,</hi> in the Lords Supper, to hold forth in a plain and Lively manner, that plentiful Provision which is made for Souls in Christ; and that one Christ is enough to fill us all: According to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation,
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:34554:228"/>
                  <hi>Eat, O Friends, Drink, yea, Drink abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, O Beloved.</hi> By this way of Arguing, might not men soon bring into that part of Gods so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Worship, as great Disorders as ever were in the Church of <hi>Corinth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So likewise should they not as well plead for the use of <hi>Musical Instruments</hi> in singing of Psalmes, as from the proper signification of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: So from the Nature of the thing, it fitly setting forth the <hi>Melody</hi> we should make in our hearts to the Lord, (<hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.19)</p>
               <p>But further, may not others as well Argue for <hi>Sprinkling,</hi> because Baptism is to signifie the Souls being cleansed by the Blood of Christ, which is called the <hi>Blood of Sprinkling,</hi> Heb. 12.24. 1 Pet. 1.2. And the Inward Washing, which the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Baptism representeth, is set forth under the Term of <hi>Sprinkling,</hi> or (as they call it) Ranti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. As the same thing was shadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out under the Law by <hi>Sprinkling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or may one not say (as Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi>) that <hi>Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> or <hi>Pouring on</hi> water, where water is applied to the Body, sets forth in a more lively manner, the Grace of Christ in washing away our sins, than <hi>Dipping,</hi> where the Body is applied to the water? That being done rather by <hi>applying Christs Blood</hi> to Us, than by applying our selves to Christs Blood.</p>
               <p>And may we not as well Argue for Baptizing, by <hi>Pouring on</hi> water (which we generally Practise) as best setting forth the Communication of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, promised to be <hi>Poured on</hi> us, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.28, 29. Certainly they are all one, to be Baptized with the Holy Ghost, and to have the <hi>Spirit poured on</hi> us.</p>
               <pb n="447" facs="tcp:34554:228"/>
               <p>Thus it is plain, that their Arguing for Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping from Allusion and <hi>Analogy,</hi> hath no strength, or Cogency at all. The same Argument may be urged against them. As they decry Baptizing by <hi>Sprinkling</hi> (which I think few or none amongst us use) or <hi>Pouring on</hi> water, as not holding forth the Burial of Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Others have the <hi>like Plea</hi> against Dipping, as not holding forth the <hi>Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Blood</hi> of Christ, and <hi>Pouring forth of</hi> his Spirit, which Baptism is as well to signifie. Let them answer here for themselves, and they will answer for us too.</p>
               <p>Here I shall only add this Note, That <hi>whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Rite</hi> be used in Baptism, whether theirs, or that which we hold best and safest in our Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, <hi>being Baptized unto Christ;</hi> it must needs follow, that we are <hi>Baptized unto his Death,</hi> and obliged to Conformity to him; and to improve Christ, to our dying more and more unto sin, and rising again to Newness of Life. And thus we are <hi>buried with Christ</hi> by Baptism, Baptism serving for this Use and End, to hold forth our Duty and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge (if Faithful in our Baptismal Covenant) of being made Conformable to his Death.</p>
               <p>As for the Objections against Dipping, as they hold it <hi>necessary for all Times, and Places,</hi> they are not so weak as <hi>H. D.</hi> would make them: Who says thus,

               <p>Some may think, I have Expatiated too far here: But <hi>is there not a cause?</hi> How many that Unchurch us in their rash Censures, and will have no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with us in other the undoubted Ordinances of Jesus Christ, because we maintain our <hi>Childrens Interest in the Covenant,</hi> and <hi>Right to Baptism,</hi> the Initiating Sign and Seal of it? What a sad Snare is the way of <hi>Anabaptism</hi> to many well-meaning, but mistaken Souls? If so deep Censuring of their Brethren, and Separating from all the Churches of Christ, that are not of their way, as the strictest, and the most of them do, be <hi>the way of Christ;</hi> Then Christ would seem to be <hi>against Himself,</hi> and then how should his Kingdom stand? Whether their way be not Injurious to the Churches Peace, to the Comfort of Christian Parents, and Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to Christs Interest in the World; let the Sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded judge. Whether the Engaging of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians Children from their Infancy, to the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment and Profession of Christianity, and enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Christian Parents to Train up their Children in such a way; or leaving both Parent and Child Free, and Uningaged here, which of these ways hath the more <hi>direct Tendancy</hi> to bring in Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and Irreligion; Let any, but such as are strangely prepossessed, and prejudiced judge.</p>
               <p>Now you that are satisfied in the point of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptism, account it not enough to own it, or that you may be able to Plead for it; but see that your Practice be such as may bring Credit and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation to it.

               <p>WHere <hi>Special Grace</hi> hath wrought the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, it will maintain the work. Where Special Grace beginneth, it will finish the work in due time. Thus the Faithful, as they have an <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate right,</hi> so on <hi>Indefeasable</hi> right to the great Benefits contained in the Covenant.</p>
               <p>The Remonstrants hold Grace to be <hi>Vincible,</hi> both in Conversion, and after Conversion. <hi>Si Deus fidem vi irresistibili quae impediri non potest, non effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit, neque sustentat:</hi> As they. And we know their
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:34554:231"/>meaning, when they deny <hi>Vim Gratiae irresistibilem;</hi> that when God had done all that belongs to Him to do, yet mans will may Frustrate his Grace, and render all ineffectual and to no purpose.</p>
               <p>If the Saints perseverance be not certain. Then,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) What becomes of <hi>Gods Decree?</hi> Here they will say, that God Electeth men upon fore-sight of Faith, and Perseverance, not <hi>unto Faith</hi> and Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance. But (methinks) the Scripture teacheth otherwise, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Elected, to be Holy:</hi> Not upon Gods Fore-sight that such would be holy. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.5. <hi>God hath chosen the Poor of this world Rich in Faith, and Heirs of the Kingdom.</hi> Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, not <hi>because Rich in Faith;</hi> but to be Rich in Faith: As they were Chosen, not <hi>because Heirs</hi> of the Kingdom; but to be Heirs of the Kingdom. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Chosen to Salvation, through sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Spirit, and belief of the Truth.</hi> He could not foresee Sanctification in any, but as the work of his own Spirit: He could not foresee Faith in any, but as <hi>his own Gift.</hi> (<hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.1.) <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. <hi>As many as were Ordained to Eternal Life, believed.</hi> Some indeed would have it taken thus: As many as were <hi>fitted,</hi> or disposed unto Eternal Life, believed. But what Disposition, or Aptitude unto Eternal Life is there found in any, <hi>before Faith,</hi> before they do believe? Besides, the word is <hi>(Plusquam perfecti temporis)</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>ordinati fuerant:</hi> As many as had been ordained to Eternal Life. Importing a <hi>previous Ordination</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a present disposition to Faith.</p>
               <p>To the like purpose consult what our Saviour saith, <hi>John</hi> 6.37, 39. <hi>All that the Father giveth me, shall come to me. And this is the Fathers will, that of all
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:34554:232"/>which he hath given me, I should loose nothing; but should raise it up again at the last day. Raise it up,</hi> that is, to everlasting Life, as it is <hi>ver.</hi> 40. Hence it is plain, that in regard of <hi>Gods Will</hi> and Purpose, all the Elect shall certainly come to Christ, and be kept by him to everlasting Life.</p>
               <p>And so much is implied in that speech of his, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.24. <hi>Insomuch that (if it were possible) they would deceive the very Elect.</hi> It is impossible that false Christs should deceive the Elect. Though in <hi>themselves</hi> they are liable to Deception, as well as others; yet <hi>being Elect,</hi> God hath a special care of them, and they are the special charge of Christ, and the holy Spirit of Truth; for which cause it is <hi>not possible</hi> they should be finally deceived, and drawn away from Christ, and Fundamental Truth.</p>
               <p>And may we not gather as much from <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>All things work together for good, to them who are the called according to his purpose.</hi> How will this hold true, and yet they may fall into the greatest of Evils, both <hi>Sinful,</hi> and <hi>Penal, Apostacy,</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 30. <hi>Whom he did predestinate, them he also called: And whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> They that can prove their <hi>Election</hi> by their <hi>effectual Vocation,</hi> may thence conclude their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>Justification,</hi> and their future <hi>Glorification.</hi> Though the former of these Texts should make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing against those, who grant the certain Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Elect as such, but not of all the Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, or Sanctified; (supposing there are some such, who are not Elect) yet this last Scripture clearly Determines that all that are called, that is, effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called (and so Sanctified) and Justified, are
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:34554:232"/>or shall be Glorified, and Consequenly must needs Persevere.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) What becomes of <hi>Divine Promises,</hi> that look this way, if the Faithful do not certainly Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe? Is not Gods Promise good Security? <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. <hi>I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.</hi> Here we see Persevering-Grace is a <hi>Gift,</hi> which God hath promised. And they in whose hearts God putteth his Fear, they shall fear him <hi>for ever,</hi> (ver. 39.) they shall not depart from him. It is Evident, and Undeniable, that this is here promised. Now it is promised ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Absolutely,</hi> or <hi>Conditionally.</hi> If absolutely, then it inevitably follows, that they must continue in his Fear, and never depart from Him; Or else where were his Truth and Faithfulness? If <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally,</hi> Then what is the Condition? Can we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it thus, <hi>I will put my fear into their hearts, that they shall not depart from me:</hi> If there will be to continue to fear me, if their will be not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part? But hold: The same thing cannot be the <hi>thing promised,</hi> and the <hi>condition</hi> unto which it is promised. <hi>Otiosa est haec conditio, facit enim per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severantiam conditionem perseverantiae: Non enim deesse gratiae sufficienti est perseverare,</hi> (Suffrag. Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. de 5. Art. p. 225.) I hope, they with whom we have to do here, would not make God, <hi>as one that Mocketh.</hi> And then how can this be the sence, <hi>I will give them to fear me, that they shall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me: Provided their will</hi> be to fear me still, and their care not to depart from me. I will give them to continue and persevere in my fear, if their will be to continue in my fear; that is, If they do continue in my fear; Certainly, they that do
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:34554:233"/>persevere, must persevere, whether God promised it, or no. <hi>No need</hi> for God to promise that, the contrary whereof would <hi>imply a Contradiction.</hi> VVe neither consult the Honour of his Wisdom, nor of his Grace, if we would have no more meant than so.</p>
               <p>And further, If the Lord promised no more here, than Grace to persevere, <hi>if we will;</hi> then there should be no more promised to Believers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> then <hi>Adam</hi> might have concluded on under the <hi>Covenant of Works. Adamo fuit datum, ut posset, si vellet in bono perseverare, sed non fuit datum, ut vellet: Nobis verò, qui verè Christo insiti sumus, talis data est gratia, ut non so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum possimus, si velimus, sed etiam ut velimus in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sto perseverare,</hi> (Aug. de Correp. &amp; grat. in c. 11. &amp; 12. Ut Suffr. Britan. ib.)</p>
               <p>Yea, the condition of Believers would be so much worse than Innocent <hi>Adams,</hi> by how much they have <hi>less strength,</hi> than he had. Innocent <hi>Adam</hi> had the fear of God in his heart, (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he had not been Innocent) and that <hi>fear pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served</hi> in his heart; must needs have <hi>prevented</hi> his departing from God. So he had that which might have kept him close to God, without any <hi>contrary principles</hi> to turn him aside. VVhereas the best of Saints upon Earth are not so perfect in Faith, or Fear, or any Grace, but that there is something of a contrary <hi>corrupt principle</hi> still remaining in them, as a Back-byas drawing them another way.</p>
               <p>Again, The Lord hath promised, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18. <hi>The Gates of Hell shall not prevail against his Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if the Faithful should not persevere, it is
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:34554:233"/>plain in this case, the <hi>Gates of Hell</hi> would prevail. Therefore the perseverance of the Faithful is <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;</hi> Or else how should this word of promise hold <hi>certainly true?</hi> If the perseverance of the Faithful be not certain, but purely <hi>contingent,</hi> that this Believer may fall away, and that Believer, and so another, and another; and if there be no one <hi>in particular,</hi> to whom it may not happen, that he may fall away, then that any should hold out to the end, and be saved, it must be <hi>purely contingent</hi> and uncertain. And if it be purely Contingent, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any one Believer in the world will persevere, what is not certain, cannot be certainly known; what is not certainly Future, cannot be certainly <hi>Fore-known.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Qualis est res, talis est rei sci en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> &amp;c. Camero. Resp. ad Ep. vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri docti. p. 162. in fol. 757.</note> VVhen Christ says, <hi>The Gates of Hell shall not prevail against the</hi> Faithful, (who are <hi>built on</hi> him, the Rock) it is certain, the Gates of Hell shall not prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, otherwise he might be mistaken, and his word not <hi>hold true.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any suppose this to be the sence, That the powers of Hell shall not prevail against Believers, <hi>without their will,</hi> and consent; if this were all, then Christ should promise here, as much as comes to nothing. There was no fear of the Devils <hi>forcing away any</hi> soul from Christ, quite against its will. Besides, what is promised to Believers, would <hi>hold as true</hi> of Unbelievers: So the Gates of Hell should not prevail against Them neither. For none will say, that Unbelievers are <hi>kept off</hi> from Christ by force, but that their wills are to keep off from him.</p>
               <p>Another Promise you have, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>God
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:34554:234"/>is faithful, who will not suffer you to be Tempted above that ye are able; but will with the Temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another, <hi>John</hi> 10.28. <hi>I give unto them Eternal Life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of my hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we must understand these Promises, as depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on such a Condition as this, that they <hi>yield not of themselves</hi> to Temptation, nor cast themselves out of Christs hands: But not as securing them at all, that they shall not <hi>Totally</hi> and <hi>Finally</hi> yield up to Temptation, and cast themselves out of his Hand; then it will follow, that they speak not at all to a <hi>Believers fears:</hi> but to what he has no fear of. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have no fear at all of being <hi>plucked away</hi> from Christ by strong hand, and against their wills; but all the fear is, whether they shall not at one time or other, be Tempted away from Christ, and their hearts prove Treacherous to Him.</p>
               <p>To these Promises, agreeth that of the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 1.6. <hi>Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good Work in you, will perform</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Finish) <hi>it until the day of Jesus Christ.</hi> Where observe, his confidence was <hi>not in them,</hi> but in <hi>him</hi> that had <hi>begun the Work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewise that of the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.5. <hi>Kept by the power of God through Faith, unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> Where we see the Lord hath them in his keeping. And, <hi>Qui custodit nos per fidem, custodit in nobis fidem:</hi> He that keepeth us through Faith unto Salvation, keepeth Faith in us to Salvation. How are they kept <hi>by his power,</hi> who are suffered to Apostatize, that they are lost Creatures? (<hi>John</hi>
                  <pb n="459" facs="tcp:34554:234"/>17.12.) Surely, such are deserted and cast off, <hi>not kept.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3.) VVhat becomes of Christs Prayer, and <hi>prevalent Intercession,</hi> if Believers shall not perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere? There is therefore <hi>no Condemnation</hi> to them, because Christ is at the Right-hand of God, <hi>making Intercession</hi> for them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. VVhat is it that Christ Sueth and Pleadeth for, on the behalf of his People? That their <hi>Faith may not fail,</hi> as he Prayed for <hi>Peter, Luke</hi> 22.32. That God would keep them through his own Name, keep them from the evil. If they are <hi>not kept</hi> from the evil of <hi>Total and Final</hi> Apostacy, How is Christs Prayer for them heard? See <hi>John</hi> 17.11, 15, 20. If there be any power in the Intercession of Christ (whom <hi>the Father heareth always</hi>) Believers shall be kept by Gods power. The Father should not <hi>have his will,</hi> if they be not kept unto Salvation, <hi>John</hi> 6.39. Neither should the Son <hi>have his will,</hi> John 17.24.</p>
               <p>And to say, that Christ meaneth no more, but that they might be kept, upon condition that they be not <hi>wanting to themselves;</hi> is as if he should only Pray that they might be kept, while indeed they shall keep themselves. So to deny the <hi>certain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance</hi> of the Faithful, is to make Christs Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession on that behalf, either <hi>Needless,</hi> or <hi>Fruitless,</hi> and <hi>Successless.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">(4.) VVhat becomes of the Saints prayers for Perseverance? And what ground have any of us to Pray, that the Lord would <hi>Ʋnite our hearts</hi> to fear his Name, that he would give us an heart to fear him for ever; or that we may be <hi>kept by his power,</hi> and so guarded with his Grace, that no Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:34554:235"/>may prevail, to draw us away from him? If the Faithful may fall away, and if God doth not <hi>promise</hi> their Perseverance, but <hi>conditionally,</hi> then the meaning of such Petitions can be no more than this: <q>Lord, keep me, so long as I have a care to keep my self. Lord, <hi>uphold</hi> me by thy Grace, so long as I have a care not to fall. Preserve me in thy fear, while I have an heart to fear thee. Give me to persevere, <hi>if I will.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="5">(5.) If the Faithful do not certainly persevere, what becomes of Gods <hi>everlasting Love</hi> to them? That Love which the Apostle doth so greatly glory in, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38, 39. Should he suffer them to draw back, his Soul could then <hi>take no more pleasure</hi> in them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38. Then he should not remember them with everlasting kindness, as <hi>Isa.</hi> 54.8, 10. Or Love them with an everlasting Love, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.3.</p>
               <p>If any Believer fall away, and perish, certainly it is not for <hi>want of Power</hi> in God. He that could quicken them, when dead in Trespasses and Sins, could <hi>settle</hi> them when <hi>Staggering;</hi> could Raise them when Fallen. I say, it is not for want of Power in God to keep them, if they be not kept: He is <hi>of power to Establish</hi> them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.25. He is <hi>able to keep them</hi> from <hi>falling,</hi> Jude ver. 24. He is <hi>able to build them up,</hi> and to give them an Inheritance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all them that are Sanctified, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.32. And otherwise the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> would not have prayed, as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. That the <hi>God of all Grace would make them Perfect, Establish, Strengthen, Settle them.</hi> Nor would Christ have Prayed for <hi>Peter,</hi> that <hi>his Faith might not fail;</hi> if it had not been <hi>in his Fathers hands,</hi> to prevent the failing
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:34554:235"/>of <hi>Peters</hi> faith. And if it be not for want of Power, it cannot be, that they are not kept for <hi>want of</hi> Love, and good will in God towards them. The Love of God being such, as brought them to the Participation of his Grace, and <hi>Reconciled</hi> them to Himself, who before were Enemies; how strange were it, if he should not continue to Love them, whom he hath Reconciled. See how the Apostle argueth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9, 10, 17.</p>
               <p n="6">(6.) VVhat ground for that <hi>joy of Faith</hi> the Scripture speaks of, if the perseverance of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful be not certain? Take away the Doctrine of <hi>perseverance,</hi> and what becomes of Assurance? VVhat ground for that Assurance, which many of the Faithful (of whom we read in Scripture) had, and all are called on, to give Diligence to obtain, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.11. VVhen we read of the the <hi>full assurance of Hope,</hi> as attainable, as in the Texts last Cited?</p>
               <p>And methinks, they which from that Caution, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12. <hi>[Let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall.]</hi> Infer, that he that standeth may fall; they should not deny, but from this Councel, and Exhortation, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Give dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to make your Calling and Election sure.</hi>] This may be Inferred, that by giving Diligence, we may <hi>make our Calling and Election sure.</hi> And conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently our Salvation. As that <hi>Golden Chain,</hi> Rom. 8.30. can never be broken, but one Link will Certainly, and Infallibly draw on another.</p>
               <p>And so when we read of the <hi>Peace of God,</hi> which passeth all understanding, keeping the heart and mind, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7. VVhen we read of the God of Hope, filling souls with <hi>joy and peace</hi> in Believing,
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:34554:236"/>
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13. And giving them <hi>everlasting Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>good Hope</hi> through Grace, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.16. VVhen we read of Believers <hi>Rejoycing with joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable,</hi> and <hi>full of Glory,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.8. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, these things do strongly Imply the Safety and Security of the Faithful. Otherwise though we do suppose their Estate at present to be <hi>never so happy,</hi> yet if their happiness be no way secured; but in the event they may be more <hi>miserable,</hi> for having once been <hi>so happy,</hi> the thought of this must needs be a <hi>great allay,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acriores sunt morsus liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis amissae.</hi> Cic.</note> and sad check to their Joy and Peace. If the state of Believers be so <hi>Lubrick</hi> and <hi>Ʋncertain,</hi> as some would have it; then what ground can they have for <hi>such an Hope,</hi> and <hi>such Peace,</hi> and <hi>such Joy,</hi> as the Scripture speaks of? Rather it would be but like <hi>Jonah's Gourd,</hi> that sprang up in a Night, and perished in a Night: VVould this afford <hi>strong Consolation,</hi> and <hi>everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Consolation,</hi> to believe that they are <hi>Elect</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to day, but may be <hi>Reprobates</hi> to Morrow? That they are <hi>Saints</hi> to day, but may be wretched <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postates</hi> to morrow? VVould this yield <hi>Joy unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> and such Peace, as passeth understanding, to apprehend their <hi>Adoption</hi> to day, but to live in fear of their <hi>Abdication</hi> to Morrow?</p>
               <p>Indeed if the Saints Perseverance and Salvation depend on their mutable, <hi>Inconstant will,</hi> not on Gods Purpose and Grace; Then how little hope is there of their Perseverance, and Eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? VVhile <hi>Innocent Adam</hi> being Tempted, was overcome; How much rather may the best of us conclude, that we shall fall by the <hi>hand of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter?</hi>
                  <pb n="463" facs="tcp:34554:236"/>VVho of us all is fit to Encounter, and go out against this <hi>Goliah?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How little hope of the Perseverance of any of the Faithful, if God hath no more promised to secure them from <hi>Total</hi> and <hi>Final</hi> Apostacy, than from common Slips, and Falls? VVhen there is scarce any probability, that we should <hi>at all times do our Duty,</hi> but much to the contrary; that partly through the Remainders of Inbred Corruption, and partly through the Impetuousness of Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we should at one time or other grow Negligent; if, as we are letting go our Hold with God, and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, the Lord should <hi>let go his Hold</hi> of us; VVhat is like to become of us at last?</p>
               <p>But should we suppose the <hi>Scales to be even</hi> here, and that it is every way as likely, a Believer will never carry himself so, as might provoke the Lord to withdraw, and to leave him to himself, <hi>as that he will;</hi> yet it is plain, that to deny the certain Perseverance of the Faithful, must needs <hi>Lessen</hi> a Believers Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. So his <hi>joy could not be full,</hi> no, not though he knew himself to be a true Believer. But admitting the <hi>certain perseverance</hi> of the Faithful, a Believer that had but a probable perswasion, (and much more being assured of the Truth and Soundness of his Faith) might have <hi>more comfort</hi> for that. As Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath well Noted: <q>If I have <hi>no perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> either of my own sincerity, or perseverance, or yet of my perseverance as certain, if I were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly sincere, then I should have <hi>two difficulties</hi> in the way of my comfort; which is more than one alone, and therefore must put me further off from comfort. But if I were sure that all true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers shall persevere, if I had withall but a
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:34554:237"/>
                     <hi>strong hope,</hi> or probability that I am a true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, I should freely receive the <hi>comfort</hi> of that probability, without the Impediment of farther doubts concerning perseverance. When other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise I should be thinking, what if I be Justified, yet how can I tell but I may lose it by Back-sli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding?</q>
               </p>
               <p>But against the certain perseverance of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, many things are Objected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. We read, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.24, 26. <hi>When the Righteous turneth away from his Righteousness,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is true, that <hi>when a Righteous man doth</hi> turn away, or if he turneth away from his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, he shall Die: But it is <hi>Propositio conditiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, quae nihil ponit in esse.</hi> An Hypothetical proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth only hold forth the Connexion as true. Not that the <hi>Antecedent</hi> shall, or may be: but if it should be, then such a thing would be <hi>consequent</hi> upon it, <hi>John</hi> 16.7. <hi>If I go not away, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter will not come.</hi> This will not prove, that it might have so fallen out, that Christ might not have departed. His going away was a thing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and Determined, notwithstanding his <hi>putting this Supposition.</hi> So <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8. <hi>If we, or an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel from Heaven Preach any other Gospel, let him be accursed.</hi> This will <hi>not prove,</hi> that an Angel from Heaven ever shall, or may Preach another Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. Do we not read of some that believe for a while, but in time of Temptation fall away? <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.20, 21. <hi>Luke</hi> 8.13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> A <hi>Temporary Faith</hi> is not a <hi>true</hi> Faith. It is there said of a Temporary believer, that he
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:34554:237"/>hath <hi>no root:</hi> But of the true believer we read, that he is <hi>born of Incorruptible seed,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.23. And that <hi>his Seed remaineth in him,</hi> 1 John. 3.9. And it is Noted as the property of the good Ground, that it <hi>bringeth forth Fruit with patience,</hi> or perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.15. That never was good Ground that only <hi>maketh a flourish</hi> for a time, but doth not bring forth Fruit to perfection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 3. Do not <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5, 6. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.26, 27, 28, 29. Speak of a Total and Final Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. To that [If we sin wilfully after, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] We answer as before to <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.24.</p>
               <p n="2">2. These Texts speak of that sin unto Death, which the Regenerate shall never fall into, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. and 5.18.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That having <hi>Tasted</hi> of the Heavenly Gift, is a Diminutive Expression, denoting a Slighty, and Superficial, not a <hi>sound Perception;</hi> signifying some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing short of that <hi>Drinking,</hi> John 4.14. <hi>Whosoever drinketh of the Water that I shall give him, shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Thirst: But the Water that I shall give him, shall be in him a Well of Water springing up into everlasting Life.</hi> Something short of that <hi>Eating</hi> and <hi>Drinking,</hi> which is by a true and lively Faith, <hi>John</hi> 6.35, 54. <hi>Whoso eateth my Flesh, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth my Blood, shall never Hunger, nor Thirst,</hi> but <hi>hath Eternal Life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. It would seem that the Apostle does not speak of <hi>true Believers,</hi> Heb. 6.4, 5, 6. But when he speaks of such, he useth another <hi>Dialect,</hi> ver. 9, 10. <hi>But beloved, we are perswaded better things of you, and things that accompany Salvation.</hi> For God
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:34554:238"/>is not Unrighteous to forget your Worth, and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of Love.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That Text, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. as they urge it, crosseth another <hi>Principle</hi> of the Objectors. There it is said, It is <hi>Impossible</hi> if such fall away, to renew them again unto Repentance. But they hold a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever may <hi>fall away Totally,</hi> and yet be <hi>raised again by Repentance.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>See Mr.</hi> Hickmans <hi>Animadver. Dr.</hi> Heylins <hi>Quinq. Hist.</hi> p. 396.</note> As <hi>Thompson</hi> would say:
<q>I am a Child of the Devil to day; but I have <hi>Free-will,</hi> and to Morrow I will make my self a Child of God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 4. Instances are brought of some that have fallen, and fallen off: As <hi>David, Solomon, Hymeneus, Philetus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is granted, some of these were in a state of Grace, and yet fell Foulely; but not <hi>Totally,</hi> and <hi>Finally.</hi> They were worsted <hi>in praelio,</hi> lost this and that Battel, and yet were on the Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing side <hi>in bello.</hi> As we read of <hi>Dan, A Troop shall overcome him; but he shall overcome at last.</hi> So however they were Foiled for some time, yet they overcame at last. Sometimes God suffereth his own Children to Fall, to make them more Humble, <hi>Cautelous,</hi> and Circumspect ever after: That they stand more surely, and walk more steadily after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>Again, Some of those mentioned, did fall quite away; but it cannot be proved, that ever they were <hi>true believers.</hi> The contrary is Intimated, when the Apostle subjoyneth that word of Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the Faithful, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, the Foundation of God standeth sure, having
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:34554:238"/>this Seal, the Lord knoweth them that are his.</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, that the other who had Apostatized were <hi>none of his,</hi> and never had a <hi>good Foundation;</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise they had stood sure. As the Apostle <hi>John</hi> hath the like, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.19, 20, 27. <hi>They went out from us, but they were not of us: For if they had been of us, they would (no doubt) have continued with us.</hi> But ye have an Unction from the Holy One, (yea, by <hi>way of contradistinction</hi> to those that went out, and fell off.) And <hi>ver.</hi> 27. <hi>The anointing which ye have received of him, abideth in you: And even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in it.</hi> So that according to the Apostles Doctrine, if those Apostates and Impostures, had ever <hi>received that Anointing,</hi> which true Believers have, they should then have <hi>abode</hi> in the Truth, and not have proved such wretched Apostates.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object,</hi> 5. If the perseverance of the Faithful be so certainly Determined, then all <hi>Exhortations</hi> and <hi>Promises</hi> to Perseverance, and all Threatnings in case of Apostacy, are needless, if not absurd. Who would make a business of it, to perswade the Sun to <hi>keep its course,</hi> that can do no other?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Est duplex genus perseverantiae, unum Physicum, quo modo coelum perseverat, &amp; Terra,— Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecto hoc genus persever antiae non admittit admonitiones. Sed est aliud genus perseverantiae quod est ab animi proposito, id vero admittit, &amp; poscit ultro admonitiones; Nam propositum animi est à judicio &amp; ratione,</hi> &amp;c. Camero praelect. p. 227. c. 2.</note> Some things <hi>Naturally</hi> hold on their Course, without any understanding of it, or Natural inclination to do otherwise; as the Sun shines, and the Fire burns, whether they are bid to do so, or no. And here it's true, it were <hi>Irrational</hi> to use
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:34554:239"/>Exhortations to that which their very <hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Natures</hi> put them forth unto. Again, others are so <hi>confirmed in their state,</hi> and course, that there is no more danger of their being Diverted, or turned aside. So are blessed Angels, and the Spirits of <hi>just men made perfect</hi> in Heaven. And therefore being <hi>fully confirmed,</hi> and no more in any danger of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from that state of Perfection; whereunto they are arrived, Ordinances, Exhortations, and the like means of Establishment are <hi>needless</hi> to them. But the perseverance of the Saints on Earth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by God, is promoted, and affected <hi>in a Rational way,</hi> with Understanding, and Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (wherein it differeth from the Course of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> Agents) joyned not only with a <hi>Natural pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> of doing otherwise; but also with <hi>great danger</hi> of their not persevering in <hi>respect of themselves,</hi> and of the manifold Temptations, which here they are surrounded, and assaulted with. In which last <hi>Respect,</hi> the state of the Saints on Earth, is differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from the state of the Saints in Heaven. And what is not needful to those blessed souls, who are <hi>absolutely freed</hi> from sin, and set so much above the Power, and reach of Temptation; yet may be <hi>needful</hi> for the preservation of the Faithful here, who are annoyed both with remainders of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption within, and with Temptations from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</p>
               <p>As the Faithful are kept, and held on in their Course by a <hi>close application</hi> of <hi>Spiritual Objects</hi> to <hi>their Faculties,</hi> all means of strengthening their Apprehension of the goodness of their way and state; are very <hi>useful,</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> for their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.</p>
               <pb n="469" facs="tcp:34554:239"/>
               <p n="2">2. And now methinks the Absurdity rather fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth on their way, who would <hi>separate</hi> the means from the <hi>end.</hi> Gods Intending and Determining the end, does not Exclude, or Overthrow, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Takes in, and Establisheth the <hi>means</hi> conducing to the Saints Establishment and Perseverance. Though they could not <hi>do the work</hi> of themselves, yet by Divine appointment they are <hi>subordinate</hi> to that power of God, which does preserve the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. The Spirit of God making use of them, and <hi>concurring</hi> with them. As Gods determining whom he will effectually Call, and Convert, does not make the Ministry of the Word <hi>needless;</hi> So nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does his Determining that these shall presevere, render the means needless. Grace is nourished and maintained by the like means, whereby it was at first wrought.</p>
               <p>Again, when God determineth that the Faithful shall be kept unto Salvation; the meaning is not, that they shall be kept <hi>without</hi> their having <hi>any care</hi> of themselves: But that he will keep up in them a care not to cast away, and Ruine themselves. <hi>Which care</hi> is promoted by Exhortations, Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Threatnings: So likewise they are kept <hi>through Faith.</hi> Now Faith submits to Divine Precepts and Admonitions, closeth with Divine Promises, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles at Divine Threatnings. Thus <hi>Faith takes in the whole Word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Take one plain Instance, Christ assureth <hi>Peter</hi> of his standing in Grace, <hi>[I have prayed for thee, that thy Faith fail not.]</hi> I hope, it was <hi>certain</hi> that <hi>Peters</hi> Faith should not fail, when Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="4 letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 6. The Doctrine of the certain perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Faithful is <hi>Securitatis pulvinar,</hi> the Bolster of Security, the Pillow of Sloath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Then Christ Preached a Doctrine of Security to <hi>Peter,</hi> when he told him <hi>[I have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that thy Faith fail not.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is possible, that some may abuse this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Saints perseverance, to sloth and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; but that is the <hi>fault of men,</hi> not of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi> So many did, and do abuse the Doctrine of Free-grace, and Justification by Christs <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> without the works of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.1. which must not therefore be rejected, as false and dangerous Doctrine.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But the Doctrine of the Saints perseverance is so far from Teaching, or <hi>encouraging to Security,</hi> that we cannot hold it, but we must hold our selves condemned by it, if we <hi>give</hi> up our selves to <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> Indeed it tends to beget in the Saints an <hi>holy Confidence,</hi> not a <hi>sinful Security.</hi> If I hold, that a Regenerate man does <hi>never fall Totally</hi> from Grace, then I must needs conclude, I cannot fall <hi>totally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Security;</hi> or fall into any sin, so as to be wholly under the power of it, and yet be a Regenerate man. These two are <hi>purely Inconsistent.</hi> To fall totally under the power of Security, or of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reigning sin, is to fall totally from God, and from Grace. So again, If I believe that all sound Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts shall continue in Gods fear, how can I hope, that I was ever a sound Convert, if I <hi>cast off his</hi> fear? Or if I have a certain perswasion, that I shall be saved, then I as little doubt of my <hi>continuing in</hi> the way to Heaven even to the end, as of my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying Heaven at last: <hi>And every man that hath
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:34554:240"/>this hope in him, purifieth himself, even as he is pure,</hi> 1 John 3.3.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Apostles Doctrine and Practice, both <hi>cuts off this</hi> Objection. As for his Doctrine, he telleth us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.29. <hi>The Gifts and Calling of God,</hi> (understand such as flow from Election, spoken of <hi>ver.</hi> 28.) <hi>are without Repentance.</hi> Yet in the same Chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. gives this Caution and Counsel: <hi>Thou standest by Faith.</hi> Be not <hi>high minded, but fear.</hi> Indeed the Doctrine of Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance doth not <hi>befriend</hi> Carnal security; nor the duty of an holy fear, <hi>Cross</hi> and Thwart the Doctrine of Perseverance: <hi>[Be not high minded, but fear.]</hi> Not that the Apostle commendeth <hi>doubting,</hi> or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust in Christians: he only opposeth <hi>Security,</hi> and <hi>Self-confidence.</hi> Christians may have an <hi>humble sense</hi> of their own Weakness, and Insufficiency, and withal an <hi>holy confidence</hi> in Gods Power, and Faithfulness.</p>
               <p>Again, where the Apostle encourageth the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful from the very Faithfulness of God to expect a good <hi>Issue,</hi> whatever Temptations they are put to encounter; yet at the same time he warneth them <hi>[Let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall.]</hi> 1 Cor. 10.12, 13.</p>
               <p>And as to his own <hi>practice,</hi> though none will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but he was fully perswaded of his own perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, yet this had <hi>no such effect</hi> as to make him Remiss and Careless. See the contrary, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There is an <hi>Anxious</hi> fear, and there is a <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi> fear. 1. There is an <hi>Anxious fear,</hi> inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding doubtfulness concerning the event. And <hi>so far as</hi> any one is certain of his perseverance, so far
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:34554:241"/>he is freed from this fear. 2. A <hi>Cautious fear,</hi> inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding such an apprehension of the evil of Apostacy, as puts the soul upon an <hi>holy care</hi> to shun it: And this is a means of preserving the Faithful. Now this is contrary to <hi>security.</hi> Therefore the Doctrine of the certain Perseverance of the Faithful is not a Doctrine of Security. We (with the Scripture, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40.) Teach it is promoted by such means, as are very <hi>opposite</hi> to security. And further, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will grant them: <q>That it is not (at least by any ordinary means) <hi>to be expected</hi> in this life, that the knowledge of our Sincerity, Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Perseverance should be <hi>so perfect</hi> as to have no degree of Doubting, Habitual or Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, at one time or other. Seeing therefore we are all <hi>Imperfect</hi> in our certainty of our Sincerity and Perseverance; it's meet and requisite that we be called on to (and so that we keep up) a <hi>Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal working,</hi> preventing fear, according to the measure of our uncertainty.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6.

<note place="margin">Res est soliciti plera timoris Amor.</note> Now will it not hence follow, even from their own Concessions, that the Certainty of the Saints Perseverance will not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily inferr, or produce <hi>Security</hi> and <hi>Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence?</hi>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Prayer is a necessary part of that Worship, and <hi>Homage</hi> due to God, an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of our Dependance on him; and that he is the Author of all that good, we either have, or hope for.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Perseverance of the Faithful is <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,</hi> this can be <hi>no Bar</hi> to their praying for it. But the Promise is an Encouragement to Prayer, and Prayer <hi>a means</hi> to obtain the Promise, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.36, 37. <hi>I the Lord have spoken it, and I will do it. Yet for this I will be enquired of by the House of Israel, to do it for them.</hi> The Lord would have his People to <hi>sue his Promise,</hi> to put his Bond in suit. As <hi>David</hi> did, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.27. And <hi>Daniel prayed with a Courage,</hi> when he understood the Number of the Years, whereof the Word of the Lord came to <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the Prophet, that he would accomplish Seventy Years in the Desolations of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.

                  <hi>Object.</hi> 8. How should God ever seriously try the Faith of his People, if he hath determined, that their Faith shall never fail?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Gods trying of his People, is not for <hi>his own sake,</hi> he knows their minds, and thoughts afar off, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139.2. That which we read, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 32.31. God left <hi>Hezekiah, to try him,</hi> that he might know all that was in his heart. Is spoken <hi>per</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, after the manner of men. The same is to be said to Gods trying of <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 22.1, 12. <hi>Exploratio obedientiae Abrahae non est ignotae deprehensio, sed notae jam illustrior patefactio &amp; so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennis approbatio.</hi> (Alting.) So it is not for his own sake, but it is for <hi>their sakes,</hi> and others sakes, that God trieth them, That they might be more known to themselves, and others. 2. Was not Christs Obedience tried, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.8. when yet there was no doubt to be made of his Obedience?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thus one might Argue as well against the <hi>Divine praescience,</hi> and deny that God foresees who shall persevere in the Faith, and consequently deny that any are Elected so much as <hi>ex fide praevisâ,</hi> (which yet they maintain) because God could not seriously try and prove their Faith, if it was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly known to him before.</p>
               <p>Indeed a new <hi>Writer</hi> hath started that strange Notion,
<note place="margin">

Their nature's such, as God cannot foresee them, because he would have them <hi>Contingent;</hi> now though I hope, his Design is good, to represent God <hi>more Lovely,</hi> and <hi>more Adorable,</hi> (as he says.) Yet the Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on seemeth to be a very bold one, and very unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:34554:242"/>of God. He best knoweth, whether here he Ploweth with <hi>Socinus</hi>'s Heifer,

And <hi>David</hi> could not think a thought, but God knew it <hi>afar off, Psal.</hi> 139.2. As a man that <hi>knows what roots</hi> are in his Garden, though there be no appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of them, yet he can say, when <hi>Spring comes,</hi> such and such a Flower will come up: So the Lord knows a mans thoughts afar off.

               </p>
               <p>Again, That God hath <hi>foretold future Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents,</hi> it is an Evidence, both that he is the true God, the Disposer and Governour of all things, <hi>Isa.</hi> 41.22, 23. and 46.9, 10. And <hi>a proof</hi> that he <hi>foresees</hi> future Contingents. Else how could he fore-tell them? God revealed to <hi>Elisha</hi> what <hi>Hazael</hi> would do to <hi>Israel,</hi> as that he would <hi>dash their Children in pieces,</hi> and rip up <hi>their Women with Child,</hi> 2 Kings 8.12. Now either this Writer must say, that God <hi>determined Hazael's will</hi> to these things, (which he would not think to be any <hi>lovely Representation of God</hi>) or else that these things were <hi>so Contingent,</hi> that God could not foresee them. As he says, <q>There are some things depend on mans <hi>will, which
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:34554:243"/>God determines;</hi> and here he fore-knows mens Wills, because he <hi>Knows</hi> as well as <hi>Does</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he <hi>Will:</hi> And there are some things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on <hi>mans Will,</hi> which we are to conceive that he <hi>determines not,</hi> but will have Contingent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>More I would have said to this, but that it would look like a Digression.</p>
               <p>First,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse, </seg>1</label> From this last Proposition here Confirmed and Cleared, we may <hi>infer the happiness</hi> of the Faithful; Gods Covenant with them being so well ordered, and so sure. They may say, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 48.14. <hi>This God is our God for ever and ever: He will be our Guide even unto death.</hi> None <hi>so safe</hi> as they, against whom the <hi>Gates of Hell</hi> shall not prevail. None <hi>so Rich</hi> as they, who have an Interest in God, in Christ, in the Promises, and in the purchased Possession: And none have their <hi>Estates so well settled.</hi> Their Estates settled by the Decree of Heaven, and their Names Enrolled in Heaven.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Therefore it is our greatest Interest and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,</hi> that we come up to the Terms of Gods Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.3. <hi>Incline your Ear, and come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me: Hear, and your Souls shall Live, and I will make an everlasting Covenant with you, even the sure Mercies of</hi> David. Of <hi>David,</hi> the Lord said, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.15. <hi>My Mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from</hi> Saul. O rest not in being only outwardly in Covenant, as <hi>Saul was!</hi> But see that you come up to Covenant-Terms, as <hi>David</hi> did. What gross and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less presumption is it for one to hope he shall be
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:34554:243"/>preserved in a State of Grace and Salvation, who never yet was in such a State?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Then what <hi>Enemies</hi> are Believers to their <hi>own Peace,</hi> and Comfort, who do not use all Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to clear up the Work of Grace, and <hi>prove themselves</hi> to be <hi>in the Faith;</hi> whereupon they might have such <hi>strong Consolation?</hi> If our Title to an outward Estate, as House or Land was que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned, we would do what we could to <hi>clear</hi> it. And why are we at no more pains to clear our Spiritual estates? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Examine your selves, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye be in the Faith.</hi> If I have Faith, it is <hi>not impossible,</hi> but upon a due Examination, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Enquiry I may come to know, I have it. And if once I know, I have true Faith, then I may know, I shall be saved: <hi>He that believeth shall be saved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Then such as can see their special Interest in God, and in the great blessings of his Covenant, have cause indeed to <hi>walk on cheerfully,</hi> but not to grow secure, or <hi>walk carelessly.</hi> None can be more certain, that they shall not fall short of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. and Glory hereafter, than that they shall not <hi>fall from Grace</hi> and Holiness here.

               <head type="sub">
                  <hi>PROP. XX.</hi> The Covenant of Grace is the best Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</head>
               <p>NOt but that the Covenant of Works was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>in its kind,</hi> and most exactly fitted to that State, wherein Man was Created. God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in required nothing but what was <hi>mans Duty,</hi> as he was His Creature. Required nothing, but what man was able to perform. And promised all that man could desire. As perfect <hi>perpetual Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> was required of Man in the Covenant of Works; so perfect and <hi>perpetual Happiness</hi> was promised thereupon. Thus the Covenant of works did excellently Comport with the state of Man in Innocency.</p>
               <p>But then the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> only can be to Mans advantage, in his fallen Estate. The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace is the best Covenant <hi>for us</hi> sinners. It is impossible, that sinners should have Relief, and Benefit by the Covenant of Works. Indeed it may be beneficial unto sinners, <hi>Occasionally, Indirectly,</hi> that is, shewing our Misery by sin, that hereby we are fallen short of Glory and Happiness, laid under the Curse and Condemnation of the Law; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Obnoxious to Gods Wrath, and subject to Death Temporal, and Eternal. Thus it is true, the Covenant of Works may be an <hi>Occasion</hi> of Awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening our Consciences, shewing what lost Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:34554:244"/>we are, should we stick to that Covenant, and if no other way be found out, but we must <hi>stand</hi> or <hi>fall</hi> by the sentence of that Covenant. And thus it may some way prepare sinners to accept of the Covenant of Grace, propounded and held forth. As the <hi>Israelites Bondage</hi> under the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Task-Masters should have prepared them to hearken to, and welcome <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> who were sent about their <hi>Deliverance, Exod.</hi> 4.31. But ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, all the benefit sinners can have this way from the Covenant of Works, is only <hi>upon supposition</hi> of a Covenant of Grace, provided to relieve them from the strict Sentence of that other Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>That sinners can have no benefit <hi>Properly,</hi> and <hi>Directly</hi> from the Covenant of Works, (which makes against them) but only from the Covenant of Grace, framed on purpose for sinners Relief.</p>
               <p>And that the Covenant of Grace is best for us: Appeareth thus,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) The Covenant of Works was for the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation</hi> and Continuation of Mans Happiness: But it speaketh not to his present case, being now sinful and miserable, whereas the Covenant of Grace was provided for his Recovery: <hi>Post naufragium tabula,</hi> a Plank after Shipwrack. The Covenant of Grace holds forth the way of Mans Restitution and Restauration to Happiness.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The Condition of the Covenant of Works, is utterly Impossible to sinners. To be a sinner, and to be perfectly Conformable to the Will and Law of God; to be a sinner, and not to be a sinner; is a <hi>plain Contradiction:</hi> It is impossible, <hi>Quod fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum est infectum fieri.</hi> But the Condition of the
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:34554:245"/>Covenant of Grace is possible, and attainable; yea, easily in it self.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But do not many Divines say, That it is as possible for a man to keep the Law <hi>perfectly,</hi> as heartily to accept of Christ upon the Terms of the Gospel?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Such Expressions must not be taken <hi>strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and Rigorously, but with a favourable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. For it is simply, and <hi>naturally impossible,</hi> that a sinner should be perfectly Conformed to Gods Law: But it is not <hi>naturally impossible</hi> that a sinner should Repent, and should come to Obey from the Heart.</p>
               <p>True, (as I have proved before) none so with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods <hi>Special Grace;</hi> yet that any, who are called on to Repent, and Believe, do it not, they can only blame themselves: The hindrance is <hi>in their Wills.</hi> They might come to Christ if they would. As Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> says:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> p. 343.</note>
                  <q>The Invitation of God is not so hard, that Man cannot fulfill it, if he would: But such as if Man would, he could not but Execute.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Sinner, How it it? Art thou unfeignedly willing to leave thy sins, that would Ruine thee for ever? Art thou <hi>heartily willing</hi> to accept of Christ; as to be Redeemed and Saved, so to be Guided, Ruled, and Governed by him? This is the <hi>Sum</hi> and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Condition of the Covenant of Grace. If thou art unwilling to this, certainly, thou <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thy self</hi> unworthy of Eternal Life, and shalt be Self-condemned. You see, they are no <hi>hard Terms,</hi> whereon Life and Happiness is offered and promised in the Covenant of Grace. If you be but willing, <hi>truly willing,</hi> it is done. And if you be unwilling
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:34554:245"/>to abandon your Lusts, that would be your Death, and unwilling to give up your selves to Jesus Christ, the only Redeemer, and an All-sufficient Saviour; it is evident, your <hi>Destruction is of your selves,</hi> that you are <hi>left without excuse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3.) The Covenant of Works requiring and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting Obedience every way perfect, as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of it, there was no provision of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> no place for a Mediator, when God made that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with man. The Covenant of Works own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no such thing, as <hi>Acceptation</hi> through, and for the Righteousness of another. But the Covenant of Grace does admit of, and <hi>hold forth a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</hi> According to the Covenant of Grace, we may be Justified and Saved for the Righteousness of another, <hi>scil.</hi> of Jesus Christ, the <hi>Lord our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness;</hi> when it was impossible that we should be Justified, and Saved by our own Righteousness. And the Righteousness of Christ (God-man) which is made over to a believing sinner for his Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is a more excellent Righteousness, than that of any meer Creature.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) The Covenant of Works holds forth no such thing, <hi>as Pardon.</hi> Absolute perfect Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence being (as I said) the Condition of it, upon the least sin, that Covenant was <hi>Irreparably broken.</hi> But the Covenant of Grace accepting of sincere Obedience, and requiring no more <hi>as its Condition,</hi> granteth out a Pardon to those, whose sins are not Inconsistent with <hi>Sincerity.</hi> And so this Covenant is capable of Renewing. Wast thou not obliged to forsake sin, and to give up thy self to Christ, and his Service, by thy very Baptism? But alas, Hast thou not <hi>broken</hi> thy <hi>Baptismal</hi> Covenant?
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:34554:246"/>Yea, Hast thou not lived long in the breach of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant? And yet if at last thou wouldst Repent, and come in to Christ, thou shouldst be pardoned, and accepted.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) Man might <hi>keep the Condition</hi> of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works for a time, and yet afterwards fall off, and lose all. God Created Man at first in <hi>a state of Integrity,</hi> with sufficient ability to Obey perfectly if he would; but did not then <hi>think meet</hi> to Engage, and Undertake for him, that his will should be ever to Obey. But such as come up to the Terms of the Covenant of Grace, stand safe, are upon surer ground than <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency. Their <hi>Perseverance</hi> is certain; and as their Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is certain, so their Salvation, and Happiness. Thus get within the <hi>Ark of the Covenant,</hi> and you are Lodged safe indeed.</p>
               <p>Now,

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse. </seg>
                  </label> 1. Here take Notice of the <hi>Riches</hi> of Divine Grace and Mercy. When man had once broken Covenant with God, one would have thought, the <hi>Divine Majesty</hi> should have been so Incensed against him for it, as never more to have dealt with man in this way; or if He did make another Covenant with man, it should have been upon <hi>harder Terms:</hi> Yet behold, and wonder, from mans breach of the Covenant of works, he <hi>takes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> to manifest more of his Grace, in making another Covenant more to his Creatures <hi>advantage,</hi> when man might rather have concluded, that he would cast off for ever, and would be <hi>favourable</hi> no more. Is this the manner of man, O Lord God? If a man find his Enemy, will he let him <hi>go well away</hi> out of his hand? God dealt not so with the Angels that fell, as he hath done with sinful men.</p>
               <pb n="483" facs="tcp:34554:246"/>
               <p n="2">2. See here the gross Ignorance, Folly, and Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>Self-justitiaries.</hi> Such as adhere to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works, and hope to be saved by their works, slighting and contemning Christ, and Grace offered. They that say to the works of their hands, <hi>ye are our Saviours:</hi> And say, we are Lords, we will not come to thee. Surely, they are miserable, foolish Creatures, they know not <hi>what is good</hi> for themselves, that go about to establish their own Righteousness, rejecting Christ, and his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness. These trust to a <hi>broken reed:</hi> To turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from Christ, to relie on ones own Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, is to build on the Sand, <hi>not on the Rock:</hi> Or as if a man leaned his hand on a Wall, and a Serpent bit him. Indeed better no hope, than <hi>false hope;</hi> Better no confidence, than Carnal confidence. It is better to have no peace, than that which is false. A <hi>lying refuge</hi> will at last prove no Refuge, will be no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, but the Confusion of those that put their trust in it. I should have far greater hopes of one that is low in Self-despair, than of one that is highly Confident in himself.</p>

                  <pb n="485" facs="tcp:34554:247"/>4.25. <hi>I know that Messias cometh, when he is come, he will tell us all things.</hi> No wonder that the Church of Christ under the Gospel hath <hi>more sight,</hi> since the Sun is Risen. Christ was <hi>darkly shadowed out</hi> under the Old Testament, but is clearly Revealed in the New. <hi>Moses</hi> was vailed, and an hard thing it was for the <hi>Jews</hi> to <hi>look to the end</hi> of that which is Abolished, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.13.) Christians have the Advantage clear of those that Lived before Christ. So that what the Prophets foretold, we may have a <hi>clearer</hi> understanding of, than they had them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. As we read, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. <hi>That not unto themselves, but unto us, they did Minister the things that are now reported.</hi> We may see those things that many Prophets, and Kings, and Righteous men heretofore could not see, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 13.17. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.24.) We may <hi>know Christ in his Offices,</hi> and special Undertaking, and his saving Benefits, of which they knew very little. Types are best ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by the presence, and coming of the <hi>Antitype.</hi> So Christians may understand the scope and meaning of the Legal sacrifices, and other <hi>Types</hi> of Christ, better than the <hi>Jews</hi> themselves did. Yea, it is a wonder, if any of us now should be Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of Christ, and the Way of Salvation by him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3.4. <hi>If our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost;</hi> such whose eyes the God of this World hath blinded.</p>
               <p>What should we think of such as enjoy the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and yet are Ignorant of Christ, and the way of Salvation by him? Must it not needs be <hi>affected Ignorance?</hi> Must it not be <hi>wilful</hi> Blindness, if not <hi>judicial</hi> too? Indeed, they that like not to receive the Truth in Love, that they might be saved, may
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:34554:248"/>justly be <hi>given up to Satan,</hi> to be further blinded, and deceived by him. That as the Philistines dealt with <hi>Sampson,</hi> so should he deal with them, even <hi>put out their eyes,</hi> blind their minds, lest the Light of the Glorious Gospel of Christ should shine into them. Do not such <hi>forfeit their eyes,</hi> who will not see the things that belong unto their peace? As it is <hi>Isa.</hi> 6.9, 10. (A Text that is Cited no less than six times in the New Testament.) Hear ye in hearing, (hear as much as ye will) but understand not: q. d. <hi>In summâ rerum abundantia peribitis fame.</hi> (As Oecolump.)</p>
               <p>The New Covenant of Grace holdeth forth Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life and Happiness more <hi>clearly</hi> than the Old. What was more darkly propounded, and promised in the Old Testament, is <hi>brought to Light,</hi> and more plainly discovered, and offered in the New. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Life and Immortality, is brought to Light, through the Gospel.</hi> Thus New Testament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promises are better Promises: Though not <hi>better for the Matter</hi> of them, yet better for the manner of propounding them. The Church of God of old, for a long time (even from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi>) had but one noted Promise, that we read of, to Live upon; and that very Dark and Mysterious too, <hi>[The Seed of the Woman, shall break the Serpents head.]</hi> And the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> had Spiritual, and <hi>Heavenly things</hi> promised more Darkly, sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed out under Earthly things; as Heaven was shadowed out under <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Land of Promise. The way unto the Holiest was not so manifest, while as the first Tabernacle was yet standing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.8. But we have <hi>Heaven opened</hi> in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and the Vail taken away.</p>
               <pb n="487" facs="tcp:34554:248"/>
               <p n="2">(2.) The Gospel-Dispensation of the Covenant is the best Dispeasation, in regard of the Easiness of Services enjoyned. Our Gospel-Service is far more easie, than the Legal-services appointed to the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Under the Old Testament, God required <hi>a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> of Outward services. Many <hi>Carnal Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> had, which stood in Meats and Drinks, and diverse Washings, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10. And many of those Services were <hi>Costly,</hi> as the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing of Sheep, and Oxen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And some of them <hi>painful,</hi> as Circumcision, and going up from the Remotest parts of the Land, to make their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> thrice a Year, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.17. The <hi>positive Institutions</hi> under the Gospel are very few, and those very plain, and easie. <hi>Christs Yoke is very easie,</hi> compared with <hi>Moses yoke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3.) The Gospel-Dispensation is the best Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peasation of the Covenant of Grace, in regard of its Extensiveness: <hi>Bonum quò Communius, eò me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius.</hi> The Old Covenant was made with one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Gentile</hi> Nations being strangers to it. Though a <hi>scattering</hi> of <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi> Proselytes were taken in, yet they were Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated into the Jewish Church, shewing that <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily</hi> salvation was not to be had, but among the <hi>Jews.</hi> It was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of the <hi>Jew,</hi> that unto them were committed the Oracles of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1, 2. Before they were the <hi>Children of the Covenant.</hi> But the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Covenant is not so Confined to any Nation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding orhers, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. <hi>Go, Preach the Gospel to every Creature. He that Believeth shall be saved. Here's good tidings of great Joy to all People.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="488" facs="tcp:34554:249"/>
               <p n="4">(4.) The Gospel-Dispensation of the Covenant is the best Dispensation, in regard of <hi>Power and Efficacy</hi> accompanying it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.8, 9, 10, 11. The Spirit was given more <hi>sparingly</hi> to those under the Old Testament, but is <hi>poured out</hi> more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in the Times of the Gospel. Those appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which the Apostle is not afraid to call <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ordinances,</hi> had less of the Spirit accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them than Gospel Ordinances have, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. The Weapons of our warfare are <hi>not Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, but Mighty through God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Gospel-Ministration is the Ministration of the Spirit, <hi>Signantèr,</hi> Emphatically, and Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.8. And is not that the best Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, that hath more of God, more of his Grace and Spirit in it?
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> p. 35.</note> It is true, as Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> hath well observed, (which preventeth an Objection some might make here) <q>If we speak of some <hi>particular Persons</hi> under the First Covenant, they were endued with <hi>greater Gifts of the Spirit,</hi> than many under the New: But more Light of Knowledge, and greater Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Abundance of Grace, is bestowed upon the Church in the time of the Gospel, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the <hi>Body of the Church,</hi> and Faithful in General.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="5">(5.) The Gospel-Dispensation is the best in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of <hi>Duration,</hi> and Continuance. Indeed as the Old and New Covenant are the same for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, so that for substance was an <hi>everlasting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. Yet as to the Outward Form, and Seals of it, it is changed: So as the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is not to be changed. The <hi>New Covenant</hi>
                  <pb n="489" facs="tcp:34554:249"/>shall never <hi>wax Old,</hi> but remain every way the same to the End of the World. The Old Covenant was to prepare, and <hi>make way</hi> for the New, and so to give way to it: But the New Covenant is not to <hi>give way</hi> to any other. There is no <hi>Third Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation</hi> to be expected here upon Earth. They are <hi>Idle Dreamers,</hi> that Talk, or Think of such a thing. The Gospel-Ministry, Ordinances, and Seals are to continue, <hi>till we all come in the Ʋnity of the Faith,</hi> and of the Knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the Stature of the Fulness of Christ, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13. Till the Lord come, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. <hi>Till the end of the World,</hi> Mat. 28.19, 20. <hi>Till the End,</hi> when Christ shall deliver up the Kingdom to God, even the Father, that God may be All in All. As for <hi>Saltmarsh,</hi> his Conceit, that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth [<hi>Till the end of the World,</hi> Mat. 28.20.] thus: Till the <hi>end of that Age,</hi> after which a Third <hi>Dispensation of the Spirit</hi> should take place, and Ministry, and Ordinances, cease: It is very gross.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Saltmarsh,</hi> his Conceit is plainly against the Gospel, and therefore (sure) is <hi>not Gospel.</hi> He opposeth the Gospel-Ministration, to the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Spirit;</hi> which is directly contrary to the Apostle, who calls the <hi>Gospel-Ministration</hi>

               <p>Others have the like Pretence for casting off Gospel-Ordinances, as when we urge, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. to prove, that the Lords Supper, is to <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue</hi> in the Church: (And if that, why not other Ord inances Instituted by the same Author?) <hi>Till he come.</hi> To this some say, He is come to them in the Spirit; and being <hi>come in the Spirit,</hi> such Ordinances are out of Date. But what Ground or VVarrant have they to understand it of his
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:34554:250"/>
                  <hi>coming in the Spirit?</hi> Will it not hence follow, that the Lords Supper was Instituted for none but Unbelievers, Carnal, unregenerate Persons, such as <hi>have not the Spirit?</hi> If they that have the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, have no more to do with this Ordinance, then we must say, it was never intended, as <hi>a Feast for</hi> Christ Friends: But for such as are none of his, (as, if any man <hi>have not the Spirit</hi> of Christ, he is none of his.)</p>
               <p>Again it is manifest, that the Apostles and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to whom Christ was <hi>come in the Spirit,</hi> did yet continue to hold Communion in this, and other Ordinances. As we read, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42. <hi>They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued stedfastly in the Apostles Doctrine and Fellowship, and in breaking of Bread, and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi> The Apostles Practice, with other Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christians, who had the Spirit in <hi>an Eminent Degree</hi> and Measure, and yet kept close to this, and other Gospel-Ordinances, plainly Condemns their VVay, and Overthrows their Conceit, who under Pretence of <hi>having the Spirit,</hi> cast off Ordinances, and think themselves above them.</p>
               <p>Therefore we are to understand another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ, to be meant in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. Then his coming in the Spirit, even his <hi>Second coming,</hi> his coming in Glory, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.26. His coming at the end of the VVorld, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.3. 37, 39. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.20.

                  <hi>Isa.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2.

               <p>And then, that the Lord hath kept the <hi>best to the last</hi> for us, that we have been brought forth under the last and <hi>best Dispensation</hi> of the Covenant, it should teach us to acknowledge his Exceeding abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Grace to Us-ward. It was not because we were <hi>better</hi> than others that went before, that we have been thus Priviledged above others.
